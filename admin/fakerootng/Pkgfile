# Description: Software that fools a program into thinking it is running as root.
#  Fakeroot-ng runs a program while fooling it into thinking it is
#  running with root privileges. When the program does something that
#  only root can do (e.g. create a device file), fakeroot-ng emulates the
#  appropriate system calls so that the program gets a consistent view of
#  its actions. Unlike the original fakeroot, fakeroot-ng uses the ptrace
#  interface, which means that it will (soon) support emulating chroot
#  jails properly.
