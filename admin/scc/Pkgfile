# Description: A tool that collects configuration data on Unix/Linux/BSD systems.
#  System Configuration Collector (SCC) is yet another configuration
#  collector. It consists of a client and a server part. The client
#  collects configuration data in a structured snapshot, compares
#  the new snapshot with the previous one, and adds differences to a
#  logbook. Then the snapshot and the logbook are converted to HTML for
#  local inspection. Optionally, the data can be sent to a system running
#  the server software. On the server, summaries of the data are generated,
#  and search/compare operations on the snapshots and logbooks are available
#  via a Web interface.
