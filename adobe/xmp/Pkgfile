# Description: Extensible Metadata Platform
#  Adobe's Extensible Metadata Platform (XMP) is a labeling technology that
#  allows you to embed data about a file, known as metadata, into the file
#  itself. With XMP, desktop applications and back-end publishing systems
#  gain a common method for capturing, sharing, and leveraging this valuable
#  metadata -- opening the door for more efficient job processing, workflow
#  automation, and rights management, among many other possibilities. With
#  XMP, Adobe has taken the 'heavy lifting' out of metadata integration,
#  offering content creators an easy way to embed meaningful information
#  about their projects and providing industry partners with standards-based
#  building blocks to develop optimized workflow solutions.
