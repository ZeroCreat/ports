# Description: An image processor and feature extractor.
# abracadabra is a generic image processing program. It supports the formats
# JPEG, PNG, GIF, GD, and GD2. It generates animated GIFs, morphs GIF
# animations, and computes single morphing steps. It also extracts features
# from several pictures to feed into the ghSOM (a neural net). It also can
# preprocess those images with filters that are either freely definable
# or have fixed implementations. It can hide messages inside an image.
