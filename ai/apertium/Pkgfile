# Description: A machine translation platform.
# Apertium is a machine translation platform, initially aimed at
# related-language pairs, but recently expanded to deal with more divergent
# language pairs (such as English-Catalan). The platform provides a
# language-independent machine translation engine, tools to manage the
# linguistic data necessary to build a machine translation system for
# a given language pair, and linguistic data for a growing number of
# language pairs.
