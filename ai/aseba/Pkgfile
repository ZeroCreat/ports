# Description: An event-based framework for distributed robot control.
# Aseba is an event-based robot framework that allows distributed
# control and efficient resources exploitation of multi-microcontroller
# mobile robots. It provides hardware modularity, better efficiency,
# and improved scalability by embedding a lightweight virtual machine in
# each microcontroller and providing an IDE to develop and debug the whole
# robot from a single place.
