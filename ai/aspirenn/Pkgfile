# Description: A C library with Python bindings to simulate spiking neural networks.
#  ASpiReNN is a little C library (with Python bindings) which provides
#  support for simple (leaky integrate-and-fire) spiking neural networks. It
#  is primarily designed for highly recurrent networks, but it can also be
#  used with multi-layer nets, though performance won't be the same. Though
#  only Leaky integrate-and-fire (for the neurons) and Spike-Timing Dependent
#  Plasticity (for learning rules) are currently implemented, adding new
#  models shouldn't be too difficult.
