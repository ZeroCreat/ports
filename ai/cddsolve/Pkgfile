# Description: A double dummy bridge solver.
# cddsolve is a double dummy bridge solver. It utilizes alpha-beta pruning
# and minimax searching to find the number of tricks a given side can take
# under the assumption of optimal play. While the complexity of the problem
# may be enormous depending on the given deal and contract, cddsolve is
# fast enough to be actually helpfull for many double dummy bridge problems.
