# Description: A grid-entry handwriting input panel.
# CellWriter is a grid-entry natural handwriting input panel. As you
# write characters into the cells, your writing is instantly recognized
# at the character level. When you press 'Enter' on the panel, the input
# you entered is sent to the currently focused application as if typed
# on the keyboard. Writer-dependent, CellWriter learns your handwriting
# for reliable recognition. Correcting preprocessor algorithms account
# for digitizer noise, differing stroke order, direction, and number of
# strokes. Unicode support enables you to write in any language.
