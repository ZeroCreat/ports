# Description: A C++ Interface to CLIPS.
# clipsmm is a C++ library that provides an interface to the CLIPS
# library. CLIPS provides a C environment for the construction of rule-
# and/or object-based expert systems used by NASA, branches of the military,
# numerous federal bureaus, government contractors, universities, and many
# companies. Several areas in which clipsmm extends the CLIPS interface
# are templated function callbacks using sigc++ slots, and encapsulated
# CLIPS execution environments.
