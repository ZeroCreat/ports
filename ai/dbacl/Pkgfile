# Description: A system for statistically classifying text into user-defined categories.
#  dbacl is a digramic Bayesian text classifier. Given some text, it
#  calculates the posterior probabilities that the input resembles one of
#  any number of previously learned document collections. It can be used to
#  sort incoming email into arbitrary categories such as spam, work, and
#  play, or simply to distinguish an English text from a French text. It
#  fully supports international character sets, and uses sophisticated
#  statistical models based on the Maximum Entropy Principle.
