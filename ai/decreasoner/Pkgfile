# Description: A common-sense reasoning program.
# The Discrete Event Calculus Reasoner allows a programmer to
# add common-sense reasoning capabilities to programs. It supports
# deduction/temporal projection, abduction/planning, postdiction, and model
# finding. It allows default reasoning about action, change, space, and
# mental states. It is based on the event calculus, a comprehensive and
# highly usable logic-based formalism. It helps applications understand
# the world, make inferences, adapt to unexpected situations, and be
# more flexible.
