# Description: A deductive reasoning AI.
# Deduce is an artificial intelligence program which accepts natural
# language sentences as input. These sentences describe properties
# and relationships between objects, (for example, amp;quot;Spot
# is a dogamp;quot;, amp;quot;A liquid will evaporateamp;quot;, or
# amp;quot;Water does not flow uphillamp;quot;). The user can then ask
# questions against that input, to which Deduce will attempt to answer
# using deductive reasoning techniques.
