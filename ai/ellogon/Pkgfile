# Description: A natural language processing infrastructure
#  Ellogon is a multi-lingual, cross-platform, general-purpose language
#  engineering environment, developed in order to aid both researchers
#  who are doing research in computational linguistics, as well as
#  companies who produce and deliver language engineering systems. As a
#  language engineering platform, it offers an extensive set of facilities,
#  including tools for processing and visualising textual/HTML/XML data and
#  associated linguistic information, support for lexical resources (like
#  creating and embedding lexicons), tools for creating annotated corpora,
#  accessing databases, comparing annotated data, or transforming linguistic
#  information into vectors for use with various machine learning algorithms.
