# Description: A file filter powered by a genetic algorithm.
# Genetic Algorithm File Fitter (gaffitter) is a command-line tool that
# uses a genetic algorithm to extract subsets of an input list of files and
# directories that best fit a given volume size such as a CD or DVD. This
# is used to find different combinations of the files on the list such
# that lost space will be minimized.
