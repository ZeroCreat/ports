# Description: A Neural network simulator.
# GENESIS (short for GEneral NEural SImulation System) is a general purpose
# simulation platform that was developed to support the simulation of neural
# systems ranging from subcellular components and biochemical reactions
# to complex models of single neurons, simulations of large networks, and
# systems-level models. It was developed as a research tool to provide
# a standard and flexible means for constructing structurally realistic
# models of biological neural systems.
