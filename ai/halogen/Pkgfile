# Description: A very powerful general-purpose natural language generation system.
# HALoGEN is an extremely powerful and easy to use general-purpose natural
# language generation system. It consists of a symbolic generator, a forest
# ranker, and some sample inputs. The symbolic generator includes the
# Sensus Ontology dictionary based on WordNet. The forest ranker includes
# a 250 million word ngram language model (unigram, bigram, and trigram)
# trained on the Wall Street Journal newspaper text. The symbolic generator
# is written in LISP and requires a Lisp interpreter.
