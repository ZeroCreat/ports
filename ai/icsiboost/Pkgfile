# Description: An implementation of BoosTexter.
#  Boosting is a meta-learning approach that aims at combining an ensemble
#  of weak classifiers to form a strong classifier. Adaptive Boosting
#  (Adaboost) implements this idea as a greedy search for a linear
#  combination of classifiers by overweighting the examples that are
#  misclassified by each classifier. icsiboost implements Adaboost over
#  stumps (one-level decision trees) on discrete and continuous attributes
#  (words and real values). This approach is one of the most efficient and
#  simple to combine continuous and nominal values. This implementation
#  is aimed at allowing training from millions of examples by hundreds of
#  features in a reasonable amount of time/memory.
