# Description: An easy-to-use discrete-time simulation framework.
# Ikaros is a framework for writing and running component-based
# simulators. It is used for simulations of brain areas and learning
# models, but is general enough to be easily used for any discrete-time
# simulations. A simulation consists of modules written in C or C++ that are
# connected in the simulator, with connections specified in an XML file. It
# runs on the console, and can optionally generate a dynamic browser-based
# UI with SVG for graphics generation. There are also socket-based hooks
# for adding a full GUI. The package contains a number of modules and
# complete documentation for working with the framework.
