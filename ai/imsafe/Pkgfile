# Description: Host-based intrusion detection by detecting changes in process behavior.
# ImSafe (Immune Security For your Enterprise) is a host-based intrusion
# detection tool. After a learning phase, it is able to detect changes in
# processes behavior, to detect buffer overflows, etc. It is implemented
# through a device driver (as a kernel patch) for the Linux kernel, but can
# also be run on other UNIX systems by using a amp;quot;sensoramp;quot;
# built upon strace.
