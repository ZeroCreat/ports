# Description: A C++ library to implement kernel machines.
# The Kernel-Machine Library is a C++ library to promote the use and
# progress of kernel machines. It is both for academic use and for
# developing real world applications. The Kernel-Machine Library draws
# heavily from features of modern C++ such as template meta-programming to
# achieve high performance while at the same time offering a comfortable
# interface. It enables compile-time selection of specialized algorithms
# on the basis of data types: for example, the specific case of a SVM
# in combination with a linear kernel can be computed by a specialized
# efficient algorithm.
