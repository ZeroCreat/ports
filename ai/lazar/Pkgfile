# Description: A predictive toxicology tool.
# lazar (Lazy-Structure-Activity Relationships) is a tool for the prediction
# of toxic activities of chemical structures. lazar derives predictions
# from databases with experimental toxicity data. It searches in these
# databases for compounds with similar structures and calculates the
# prediction from their measured activities.
