# Description: A C++ template container implementation of kd-tree k-dimensional space sorting.
# libkdtree++ is a C++ template container implementation of k-dimensional
# space sorting, using a kd-tree. It sports a theoretically unlimited
# number of dimensions, and can store any data structure. Provided the
# data structure, it provides operator[0 - k-1] to access the individual
# dimensional components (arrays, std::vector already do) and a std::less
# implementation for the type of dimensional components. It has support
# for custom allocators, implements iterators, and provides standard find
# as well as range queries. It has amortised O(lg n) time (O(n lg n) worst
# case) on most operations (insert/erase/find optimised) and worst-case O(n)
# space, and also provides a means to rebalance and thus optimise the tree.
