# Description: The library of Evolutionary Optimization Methods for Real Domains
# PEXESO Evolutionary Methods Library is the library of Evolutionary
# Optimization Methods for Real Domains. It is based on the original
# Object Oriented Algorithmic model that consists of the multi- operators
# technology (currently it supports 13 operator types) and amp;quot;open
# policyamp;quot; on the selection strategy (currently 4 selection
# strategy types). Using this method you have a possibility to compose
# your own optimization method using some combination of operators and
# selection strategies, or you can use one of 3 precomposed algorithms. It
# is provided with several examples and comprehensive HTML documentation.
