# Description: A user-space access library for the Phidget devices.
# libphidgets is a user-space access library for the Phidget devices. It
# provides a generic and flexible way to access and interact with the
# Phidgets, and comes with all the advantages of a user-space library. It
# is based on libhid (which is based on libusb), thus it requires no HID
# support in the kernel. Furthermore, it aims to support all operating
# system supported by libusb/libhid: Linux, BSD, OS X, and Windows.
