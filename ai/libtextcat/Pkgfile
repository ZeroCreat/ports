# Description: A library for efficient, lightweight text classification.
# Libtextcat is a library with functions that implement the classification
# technique described in Cavnar amp;amp; Trenkle, amp;quot;N-Gram-Based
# Text Categorizationamp;quot;. It was primarily developed for language
# guessing, a task on which it is known to perform with near- perfect
# accuracy. Considerable effort went into making this implementation fast
# and efficient. The language guesser processes over 100 documents/second
# on a simple PC, which makes it practical for many uses.
