# Description: A theorem prover for first-order logic with equality.
# Logic Reasoner is a theorem prover for first-order logic with
# equality. The main objective leading the development of Logic Reasoner has
# been the creation of a flexible architecture: in particular, the program
# has been designed as a generic infrastructure for theorem proving, which
# forms the basis for a collection of specific proving techniques. These
# techniques can be easily combined or replaced to create configurations
# with different properties.
