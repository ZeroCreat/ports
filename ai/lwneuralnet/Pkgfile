# Description: A lightweight implementation in C of a backpropagation neural network.
# Lightweight Neural Network is a lightweight implementation in C of
# a backpropagation neural network. It is intended for use in programs
# that just happen to need a simple neural network and do not want to
# incorporate a needlessly complex neural network library. It features
# multilayer backpropagation neural network with settable momentum and
# learning rate, easy portability, and small size. Included is an example
# application that trains a neural network to recognize handwritten digits.
