# Description: A cross-platform framework for audio recognition and NLP.
# MARF is a general cross-platform framework with a collection of algorithms
# for audio (voice, speech, and sound) and natural language text analysis
# and recognition, along with sample applications (identification, NLP,
# etc.) of its use. MARF can run distributed over the network (CORBA,
# Java RMI, and Java XML-RPC Web Services) and may act as a library in
# applications or be used as a source for learning and extension.
