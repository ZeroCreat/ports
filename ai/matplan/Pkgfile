# Description: A dynamic single agent transport planner for vehicle routing and dial-a-ride.
# (Multi-Agent) Transport Planner is a dynamic single agent transport
# planner for vehicle routing problems and dial-a-ride problems. These
# problems occur in every public transport and transportation company,
# but although some older algorithms can be found in the literature, a good
# implementation has never been published. It uses a (very quick) standard
# insertion technique to insert orders one by one into a set of routes.
