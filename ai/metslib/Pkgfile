# Description: An object-oriented metaheuristics framework.
# METSlib is an object-oriented metaheuristics framework in C++ designed to
# make implementing or adapting models easy. The model is modular: all the
# implemented search algorithms can be applied to the same model. METSlib
# implements the basics of some metaheuristics algorithms, such as Random
# Restart Local Search, Variable Neighborhood Search, Iterated Local
# Search, Simulated Annealing (with linear, exponential, and custom cooling
# schedules), and Tabu Search. For each algorithm, you must implement an
# objective function, a neighborhood (move manager), and some moves.
