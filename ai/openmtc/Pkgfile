# Description: An intelligent vector space text classification library.
# openMTC is an intelligent vector space text classification library that
# can give a relationship percentage based on text classified against a
# trained vector space. The vector space can support multiple classification
# categories (multiple trained sets to classify against). The library was
# developed in 100% C# (MonoDevelop) and also has a GTK# front end example.
