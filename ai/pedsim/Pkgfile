# Description: A simple microscopic pedestrian simulation system.
# pedsim is a simple microscopic pedestrian simulation system. It consists
# of a simulation core, and some functions that direct the pedestrians'
# desires. It outputs POV-Ray files and an XML-like data stream, which
# can be used to attach external viewers, in order to watch the progress
# of the simulation in real time. It is suitable for use in evacuation
# simulations, games, and movies.
