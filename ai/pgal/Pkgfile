# Description: A genetic algorithm library that parallelizes a genetic algorithm.
# The Parallel Genetic Algorithm Library (PGAL, pronounced
# amp;quot;Piggleamp;quot;) is a C++ toolkit for simply, efficiently,
# and swiftly producing genetic algorithm code that works across multiple
# processors. This is useful not only for those with multi-processor
# computers, but also for distributed and cluster computing genetic
# algorithm environments such as openMosix.
