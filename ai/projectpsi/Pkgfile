# Description: A multi-agent application development framework.
#  PSIworld (Programmable Scalable Interactive World) is a framework
#  that provides a set of libraries, utilities, and applications
#  to ease the implementation of dynamic artificial intelligence
#  environments. Specifically, the development of multi-agent applications
#  is targeted. It is designed in a generic manner so that various kinds
#  of applications can use it. This framework not only includes pure
#  algorithm libraries for AI computation tasks, but also a C/C++ library
#  for distributed computation. A server-client model also involves various,
#  concurrent visualization methods of distinct Agents or Societies.
