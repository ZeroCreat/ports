# Description: A library for developing scalable data-warehouse, machine learning applications.
# Jigsaw is an embedded data-store designed for the development of
# data-warehouse, analytical, and machine learning applications. Jigsaw
# can perform over one million operations a second, and scale to store
# tera-bytes of data. The object library contains classes for representing
# ordered and unordered mappings, highly compressed bit vectors with a range
# of set theoretic operators, and directly integrates a high performance
# sort system.
