# Description: Tools for programming mobile robots in Python.
# Pyro, Python Robotics is a top-down approach to programming real and
# simulated robots. It is a library, GUI, and set of objects in Python
# that allows beginning and experienced roboticists alike to easily
# control mobile robots. It comes with a simulator, and also works with
# Player/Stage/ Gazebo. Hardware supported includes ActivMedia's Pioneer,
# K-Team's Khepera and Hemisson, Sony's AIBO, Evolution's ER1, and
# others. It also contains Python code for artificial neural networks,
# genetic algorithm/programming, vision (V4L), self-organizing maps,
# mapping, localization, and more AI-related code.
