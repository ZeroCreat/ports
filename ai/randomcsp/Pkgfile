# Description: A library and program to generate binary constraint satisfaction test problems.
# RandomCsp is a set of C++ classes and a set of programs for generating
# test sets for binary constraint satisfaction problems. Several models are
# currently available. The classes are useful for implementing algorithms
# that solve these problems.
