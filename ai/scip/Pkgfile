# Description: A branch-cut-price-and-propagate framework for constraint integer programming.
# SCIP (Solving Constraint Integer Programs) is a framework for constraint
# integer programming oriented towards the needs of mathematical programming
# experts who want to have total control of the solution process and
# access detailed information down to the guts of the solver. It integrates
# techniques from mixed integer programming, constraint programming, and
# SAT solving. It can also be used as a pure MIP solver or as a framework
# for branch-cut-and-price. In order to use it, you have to link to an LP
# solver. It currently supports CLP, CPLEX, Mosek, Soplex, and XPress-MP.
