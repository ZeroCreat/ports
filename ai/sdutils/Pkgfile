# Description: An implementation of the Stochastic discrimination algorithm.
# Stochastic discrimination is a general methodology for constructing
# classifiers appropriate for pattern recognition. It is based on combining
# arbitrary numbers of very weak components, which are usually generated
# by some pseudorandom process, and it has the property that the very
# complex and accurate classifiers produced in this way retain the ability,
# characteristic of their weak component pieces, to generalize to new data
# as complexity increases. These utilities provide an implementation of
# this algorithm.
