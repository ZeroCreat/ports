# Description: A large scale machine learning toolbox.
# SHOGUN is a machine learning toolbox whose focus is on large scale
# kernel methods and especially on Support Vector Machines (SVM). It
# provides a generic SVM object interfacing to several different SVM
# implementations, all making use of the same underlying, efficient kernel
# implementations. Apart from SVMs and regression, SHOGUN also features a
# number of linear methods like Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Linear
# Programming Machine (LPM), (Kernel) Perceptrons, and algorithms to train
# hidden Markov models. SHOGUN can be used from within C++, Matlab, R,
# Octave, and Python.
