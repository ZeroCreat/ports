# Description: A graphical artificial chemistry simulator.
# SimSoup is a graphical artificial chemistry simulator for Linux and
# Windows. The program enables a chemistry to be defined in terms of
# molecule types and the possible interactions between them. A simulation
# run involves setting up a number of molecules of various molecule
# types in a reactor, and then allowing interactions to take place over a
# period of time. Interactions taking place in the reactor are shown on a
# graphical display. The motivation for development of the program is to
# enable investigations into the behaviour of networks, particularly in
# relation to 'metabolism first' theories of the origin of life, although
# the basic design supports modeling of any network in which interactions
# can take place between nodes. Currently, development has reached the
# prototype stage.
