# Description: A Turing Machine simulation.
# Turing Machine (C++ Implementation) is a Turing machine simulation that is
# defined by a series of input files. These include a metafile containing
# data related to some Turing machine, a states file containing a list
# of initial, halting, and internal states, an alphabet file of empty,
# input, and internal symbols, a transition file of transition rules,
# and input word files, which detail the input given on a tape.
