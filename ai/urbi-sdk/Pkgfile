# Description: A robotics software plateform for aibo.
# URBI (Universal Real-time Behavior Interface) gives you a simple but
# powerful way to control any type of robot or complex system like a video
# game, using a convenient and easy-to-use scripting language that can be
# interfaced with several popular programming languages (such as C++, Java,
# and Matlab) and OSes. URBI is based on a client/server architecture, which
# give a great deal of flexibility. URBI includes powerful features such
# as parallel execution of commands, event programming, command tagging,
# and dynamic variables.
