# Description: A dynamic XML processing engine.
# The XEVM is an XML processing engine. It's a multi-threaded, Pub/Sub
# environment for dynamic programming on an event-driven state machine
# with TCP communications, tight fault free memory management, powerful
# set algebra, and a magical database. It is 100% C++ (25,000 LOC), with
# a thin porting layer; there are implementations for POSIX (Mac/Linux)
# and Win32. The XEVM is for processing XEPL (the Xepl Engine Programming
# Language).
