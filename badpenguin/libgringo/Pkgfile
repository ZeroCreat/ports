# Description: binary and library replacement for dialog.
#  libgringo is a library to writes applications that run both in console
#  (using ncurses) and under X-Window (using gtk). libgringo detects if you
#  are running from the console or under X-Window, and selects the right
#  library to use without recompiling your code. gringosh and gringodlg are
#  two parsers that use libgringo to provide similar functionality to the
#  cdialog utility. It was written to make some configuration scripts work
#  both in console and under X Windows without any modification. gringosh
#  and gringodlg also provide features more powerful than cdialog such as
#  the ability to have more than two buttons per form and more than two
#  windows on the screen.
