# Description: A library and tools for hardware and kernel module detection.
#  libhardware is a very small static library used in many utilities that are
#  part of the &quot;Bad Penguin&quot; distribution. It provides functions
#  to access information about your system hardware, to detect the hardware,
#  and to handle kernel modules automatically. It is able to enumerate all
#  PCI devices, enumerate all EIDE disks and CDROMs, enumerate all SCSI
#  disks and CDROMs, enumerate all EIDE/SCSI disk partitions, and check if
#  a detected device is supported in the Linux kernel using a custom PCI
#  database. It can also handle USB devices. The included shell scripts
#  'probedisk' and 'probepart' detect disks, CDROMs, and partitions. The
#  included 'scanmodule' utility allows you to detect devices and load
#  their kernel modules automatically.
