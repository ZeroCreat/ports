# Description: BASH Debugger
#  BASH Debugger provides a patched BASH that enables better debugging
#  support as well as improved error reporting. It also contains the most
#  comprehensive source code debugger for BASH that has been written. It can
#  be used as a springboard for other experimental features (such as adding
#  hashtables), since development is maintained openly and developers are
#  encouraged to participate.
