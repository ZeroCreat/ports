# Description: Concurrent, On-the-fly Audio Programming Language
#  ChucK is a new audio programming language for real-time synthesis,
#  composition, and performance, which runs on commodity operating systems.
#  ChucK presents a new time-based concurrent programming model, which
#  supports multiple, simultaneous, dynamic control rates, and the ability
#  to add, remove, and modify code, on-the-fly, while the program is running,
#  without stopping or restarting.
