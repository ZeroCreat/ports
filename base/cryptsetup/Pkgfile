# Description: configures encrypted block devices
#  Cryptsetup provides a command-line interface for configuring encrypted
#  devices. This is done using the Linux kernel device mapper target
#  dm-crypt. This version of cryptsetup has integrated support for LUKS.
#  cryptsetup is backwards compatible with the on-disk format of cryptoloop,
#  but also supports more secure formats. This package includes support
#  for automatically configuring encrypted devices at boot time via the
#  config file /etc/crypttab. Additional features are cryptoroot support
#  through initramfs-tools and several supported ways to read a passphrase or
#  key. configures encrypted block devices Cryptsetup provides a command-line
