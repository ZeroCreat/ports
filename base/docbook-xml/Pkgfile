# Description: standard XML documentation system, for software and systems
#  DocBook is an XML document type definition (DTD). That is, it contains
#  the "DocBook" document structure. This is used by authors or editors
#  writing documents in the DocBook XML format. DocBook was designed for
#  books, articles, or reference documentation about technical matters
#  or software. It has emerged as an open, standard DTD in the software
#  industry, and is the documentation system of choice for many free
#  software projects.
#  This package contains the XML DTD for DocBook, which describes the
#  formal structure for documents following this format. If you wish to
#  author DocBook documents using SGML rather than XML, use the 'docbook'
#  package. You will need other packages in order to edit (psgml), validate
#  (opensp, libxml2-utils) or format (docbook-xsl, docbook-dsssl) DocBook
#  documents.
#  This package ships with the latest DocBook 4.5 XML DTD, as well as a
#  select set of legacy DTDs for use with older documents, including 4.0,
#  4.1.2, 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4.
