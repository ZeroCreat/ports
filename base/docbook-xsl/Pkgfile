# Description: stylesheets for processing DocBook XML files to various output formats
#  These are modular XSL stylesheets for processing documents composed
#  with the DocBook XML DTD and its derivatives ("Simplified" DocBook XML,
#  JRefEntry DTD, etc.).
#  The stylesheets provide XSLT transformations for (X)HTML, WordML, HTML
#  Help, JavaHelp, Man page (nroff), Website, Eclipse Platform Help file
#  and Formatting Object (FO) output. The latter can be further processed
#  to a number of print formats using FOP or TeX-based tools.
#  The stylesheets are modular in the sense that you can extend and,
#  to some extent, customize them. The documentation is included in a
#  separate package.
