# Description: emulates the detach/attach feature of screen
#  dtach is a tiny program that emulates the detach feature of screen,
#  allowing you to run a program in an environment that is protected from
#  the controlling terminal and attach to it later. dtach does not keep
#  track of the contents of the screen, and thus works best with programs
#  that know how to redraw themselves.
#  dtach does not, however, have the other features of screen, such as its
#  support of multiple terminals or its terminal emulation support. This
#  makes dtach extremely tiny compared to screen, making it more easily
#  audited for bugs and security holes, and also allows it to fit in
#  environments where space is limited, such as on rescue disks.
