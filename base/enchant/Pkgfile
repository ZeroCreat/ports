# Description: A cross-platform abstract layer for spell-checking.
#  Enchant is a cross-platform abstract layer for spell-checking. It is a
#  meta spell-checking framework. It recognizes that different languages
#  often require radically different tools and alogrithms to spell-check and
#  correct. It also takes into account that systems often have a radical
#  host of spell- checking software installed. It provides a standard C
#  API/ABI for all of its backends, while allowing multiple backends to be
#  loaded and used at once.
