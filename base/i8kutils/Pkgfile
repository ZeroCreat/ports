# Description: utilities for Dell Inspiron and Latitude laptops
#  This is a collection of utilities to control Dell Inspiron and Latitude
#  laptops. It includes programs to turn the fan on and off, to read fan
#  status, CPU temperature, BIOS version and to handle the volume buttons
#  and Fn-keys.
#  The package includes also a small Tk applet, designed to be swallowed
#  in the gnome panel, which monitors the CPU temperature and controls
#  automatically the fans accordingly to user defined thresholds.
#  The programs require the kernel module i8k.o which can be compiled
#  from the package sources or found in Linux kernel 2.4.14 and later
#  versions. The kernel module has been tested only on Inspiron 8000 laptops
#  but it should work on any Inspiron and Latitude laptops.
