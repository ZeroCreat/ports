# Generic logrotate for flat files or multilog directories.
# Format is FreeBSD rc.conf style (see http://iain.cx/src/logrotate/ or

# Configuration:
# Edit these as appropriate:
#     $archive is where the rotated logs will go.
#     $firstly will be run before the script does anything.
#     $finally will be run before the script exits.
# Set $verbose to something to be verbose (or use the argument -v).

# List of logs

# Define your targets:
# For each xxx in $logs, you MUST define:
#   path_xxx: Directory where the logs are stored.
#   files_xxx: Files (or multilog directories) to be rotated (wildcards are OK).
# You MAY define:
#   prefix_xxx: 
#   suffix_xxx:
#     By default, logs are archived into $archive/yyyy/$xxx/yyyy-mm-dd.gz.
#     Use these variables to change this to
#     $archive/yyyy/$prefix_xxx/$xxx.$suffix_xxx/yyyy-mm-dd.gz.
#   hup_xxx: Command to be run after processing xxx.
#   touch_xxx: Set to something to touch the logfile after rotating.
#   keep_xxx: Set to something to keep the logfile and not delete it.
#   copy_xxx: Set to something to snapshot the logfile and archive the copy.
#   old_xxx: Override the suffix with which archived (kept) files will be 
#            renamed.  Default is .old.
