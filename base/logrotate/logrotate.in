#
# Generic logrotate for flat files or multilog directories.
# Format is FreeBSD rc.conf style (see http://iain.cx/src/logrotate/ or 
# example below).
#
# Changes:
# 2006-11-20: Paths to everything else are configurable.
# 2006-02-17: Old file suffix is configurable.
# 2004-01-14: Added copy_xxx option.
# 2003-05-21: Path to gzip is configurable.
# 2003-05-21: One of the gzip actions didn't have return code checked.
