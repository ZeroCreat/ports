# Description: An automount daemon for hotplug devices.
#  mntd is an automount daemon and shared library written for automatically
#  mounting hotplug devices such as USB sticks, Compact Flash cards, or
#  other mountable devices on Linux 2.4.x and 2.6.x kernels. You only have
#  to plug in your hotplug device and wait a little bit. The library can
#  be used for user mode programs that want to be informed when devices
#  are mounted and unmounted. It will use now devfs to get the device
#  changes. So no need for hal and udev any more.
