# Description: MPEG1 and MPEG2 video decoder library
#  libmpeg2 is a library which can decode MPEG1 and MPEG2 video streams.
#  The main features in libmpeg2 are:
#  * Conformance - libmpeg2 is able to decode all mpeg streams that
#  conform to
#  certain restrictions. For streams that follow these restrictions, libmpeg2
#  is probably 100% conformant to the mpeg standards - and there's a pretty
#  extensive test suite to check this.
#  * Speed - there has been huge efforts there, and libmpeg2 is probably the
#  fastest library around for what it does.
#  * Portability - most of the code is written in C, and when
#  platform-specific
#  optimizations are used, there always is a generic C routine to fall back
#  on. This should be portable to all architectures - at least we have heard
#  reports from people running this code on x86, ppc, sparc, arm and sh4.
#  * Reuseability - libmpeg2 is not intended to include any project-specific
#  code, but it should still include enough features to be used by very
#  diverse projects.
#  This package contains the libmpeg2 shared libraries.
