# Description: remote incremental backup
#  rdiff-backup backs up one directory to another, possibly over a
#  network. The target directory ends up a copy of the source directory,
#  but extra reverse diffs are stored in a special subdirectory of that
#  target directory, so you can still recover files lost some time ago. The
#  idea is to combine the best features of a mirror and an incremental
#  backup. rdiff-backup also preserves subdirectories, hard links, dev files,
#  permissions, uid/gid ownership, modification times, extended attributes,
#  acls, and resource forks.
#  Also, rdiff-backup can operate in a bandwidth efficient manner over
#  a pipe, like rsync. Thus you can use rdiff-backup and ssh to securely
#  back a hard drive up to a remote location, and only the differences will
#  be transmitted. Finally, rdiff-backup is easy to use and settings have
#  sensible defaults.
