# Description: LaTeX and TeX for Hypertext (HTML) - executables
#  TeX4ht is a highly configurable TeX-based authoring system for producing
#  hypertext. It interacts with TeX-based applications through style files
#  and postprocessors, leaving the processing of the source files to the
#  native TeX compiler. Consequently, TeX4ht can handle the features of
#  TeX-based systems in general, and of LaTeX in particular.
#  TeX4ht can be used both for authoring HTML using TeX/LaTeX input files,
#  or for converting existing TeX input files (in any format) into HTML,
#  with (usually) only minor modifications. Other varieties of hypertext
#  can also be produced, including XML, XHTML, MathML and the Openoffice.org
#  format of XML.
#  There are a number of different ways to convert glyphs and graphics
#  in the DVI files into PNG, GIF or JPEG. The default is to use
#  dvipng. Alternatives using ghostscript, imagemagick, netpbm and/or
#  pstoedit are also possible.
#  This package contains the architecture dependent executables for TeX4ht.
