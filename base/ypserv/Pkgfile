# Description: Simple network lookupservice consisting of databases and processes
#  The Network Information Service (NIS) provides a simple network lookup
#  service consisting of databases and processes. It was formerly known as
#  Sun Yellow Pages (YP). The functionality of the two remains the same,
#  only the name has changed. Its purpose is to provide information, that
#  has to be known throughout the network, to all machines on the network.
