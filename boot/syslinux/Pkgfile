# Description: Bootloader for Linux/i386 using MS-DOS floppies
#  SYSLINUX is a boot loader for the Linux/i386 operating system which
#  operates off an MS-DOS/Windows FAT filesystem. It is intended to simplify
#  first-time installation of Linux, and for creation of rescue and other
#  special-purpose boot disks.
#  It can also be used as a PXE bootloader during network boots.
#  SYSLINUX is probably not suitable as a general purpose boot
#  loader. However, SYSLINUX has shown itself to be quite useful in a number
#  of special-purpose applications.
