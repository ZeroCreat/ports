# Provides: clutter-gst
# Description: GStreamer Integration library for Clutter
# Clutter-GStreamer (clutter-gst) is an integration library for using GStreamer
# with Clutter.
#  Clutter is an open source software library for creating fast, visually
# rich and animated graphical user interfaces. It uses OpenGL for drawing
# primitives and has multiple backends, allowing its usage on different
# platforms.
#  GStreamer is a streaming media framework, based on graphs of filters
# which operate on media data.  Applications using this library can do
# anything from real-time sound processing to playing videos, and just
# about anything else media-related.  Its plugin-based architecture means
# that new data types or processing capabilities can be added simply by
# installing new plug-ins.
