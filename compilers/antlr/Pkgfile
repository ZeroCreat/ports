# Description: An advanced, easy-to-use parser and translator generator
#  ANTLR (ANother Tool for Language Recognition) is a language tool
#  that provides a framework for constructing recognizers, compilers,
#  and translators from grammatical descriptions containing C++, Java, or
#  Sather actions. It is similar to the popular compiler generator YACC,
#  however ANTLR is much more powerful and easy to use. ANTLR-produced
#  parsers are not only highly efficient, but are both human-readable and
#  human-debuggable (especially with the interactive ParseView debugging
#  tool). ANTLR can generate parsers, lexers, and tree-parsers in either C++,
#  Java, or Sather. ANTLR is currently written in Java.
