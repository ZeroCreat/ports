# Description: A translation-based natural language steganography system.
#  Lost in Translation is a steganographic encoder that exploits the
#  possibilities of steganographically embedding information in the "noise''
#  created by automatic translation of natural language documents. Because
#  natural language translation inherently creates plenty of room for
#  variation, it is ideal for steganographic applications. Also, because
#  there are frequent errors in legitimate automatic text translations,
#  additional errors inserted by an information hiding mechanism are
#  plausibly undetectable and would appear to be part of the normal noise
#  associated with translation.
