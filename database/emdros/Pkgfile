# Description: A corpus query system for analyzed text.
#  Emdros is a corpus query system for storing and searching linguistically
#  annotated text. It is very generic, supporting almost any kind of
#  annotation from almost any linguistic theory. All linguistic levels of
#  analysis are supported, including phonology, morphology, the lexical
#  level, syntax, and discourse. The core libraries act as a middleware
#  layer between a client and an underlying SQL database. MySQL, PostgreSQL,
#  and SQLite are supported.
