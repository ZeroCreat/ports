# Description: object-relational SQL database, version 8.3 server
#  PostgreSQL is a fully featured object-relational database management
#  system. It supports a large part of the SQL standard and is designed
#  to be extensible by users in many aspects. Some of the features are:
#  ACID transactions, foreign keys, views, sequences, subqueries, triggers,
#  user-defined types and functions, outer joins, multiversion concurrency
#  control. Graphical user interfaces and bindings for many programming
#  languages are available as well.
#  This package provides the database server for PostgreSQL 8.3. Servers
#  for other major release versions can be installed simultaneously and
#  are coordinated by the postgresql-common package. A package providing
#  ident-server is needed if you want to authenticate remote connections with
#  identd. object-relational SQL database, version 8.3 server PostgreSQL
