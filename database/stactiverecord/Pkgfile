# Description: A C++ library that makes simple database usage simple.
#  StactiveRecord is a C++ library designed to make simple database use
#  simple. It was inspired by Ruby on Rails' Active Record, however,
#  no similar look, feel, or performance is guaranteed. It uses an
#  object-relational mapping pattern to represent records as objects. It
#  also provides persistent (basic) object relationships (one to many,
#  many to many, one to one).
