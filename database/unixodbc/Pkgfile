# Description: Provides ODBC 3 connectivity for Unix.
#  The unixODBC project provides Unix applications with the same ODBC
#  3.51 API and facilities available under Windows. It provides a Driver
#  Manager that supports the full ODBC API and performs the ODBC 3 to ODBC
#  2 translations with UNICODE to ANSI conversion. It also includes a set of
#  graphical utilities that allow users to specify connections to DBMSes to
#  be used by applications, a collection of ODBC drivers including a simple
#  text based driver, an NNTP driver, a Postgres driver and others, and
#  a selection of templates and libraries that to aid in the construction
#  of ODBC drivers. It works with MySQL, Postgres, StarOffice/OpenOffice,
#  Applixware, iHTML, PHP, Perl DBD::ODBC, and many other applications and
#  drivers. Connection pooling is also provided to increase performance
#  with applications such as PHP.
