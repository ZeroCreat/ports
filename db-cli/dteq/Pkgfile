# Description: A query tool that passes results through a template. It is
# well-suited for auto-generating all kinds of things from a database like
# authentication tables, DNS zone files, or whatever you can come up with.
# It also does updating commands like INSERT and UPDATE and reports back the
# number of rows affected. This used to be named mysqlquery but it is now
# DB-independent. It has a MySQL, a PostgreSQL, and a cdb driver.
# Adding support for other data sources is trivial.
