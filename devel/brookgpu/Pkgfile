# Description: A compiler and runtime system to compile C-like code to the video card.
#  Brook for GPUs is a compiler and runtime implementation of the Brook
#  stream programming language for modern graphics hardware. The goals
#  for this project are to demonstrate general purpose programing on GPUs,
#  to provide a useful tool for developers who want to run applications on
#  GPUs, and to research the stream language programming model, streaming
#  applications, and system implementations.
