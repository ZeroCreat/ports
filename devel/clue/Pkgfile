# Description: An ANSI C compiler for JavaScript and Lua.
#  Clue is an experimental ANSI C compiler that targets high level dynamic
#  languages like Lua, JavaScript, Python, and Perl. It is designed to be
#  very easy to adapt to new targets. It is currently under development
#  and is more interesting than useful, although it is complete enough to
#  run several benchmarking tools (including Whetstone).
