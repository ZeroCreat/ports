# Description: A plug-in framework for C programs.
# C-Pluff is a plug-in framework for C programs. It has been strongly
# inspired by the Java plug-in framework in Eclipse. C-Pluff focuses on
# providing core services for plug-in interaction and plug-in management. It
# aims to be platform neutral and supports dynamic changes to plug-in
# configuration without stopping the whole application or framework. It
# does not yet provide special facilities for distribution such as signed
# plug-in packages or remote plug-in repositories, but it is possible to
# build such features on top of the current framework.

# URL: http://www.c-pluff.org/
# Maintainer: Roman Senn <rs@adfinis.com>
# Depends on: libc6, libexpat1, libreadline5
