# Description: A source code analyzer and refactoring browser for collections of C programs.
# CScout is a source code analyzer and refactoring browser for collections
# of C programs. It can process workspaces of multiple projects, mapping
# the complexity introduced by the C preprocessor back into the original
# C source code files. CScout performs an analysis of C source code that
# is more detailed and accurate than current compilers and linkers, as it
# takes into account the identifier scopes introduced by the C preprocessor
# and the C language proper scopes and namespaces.
