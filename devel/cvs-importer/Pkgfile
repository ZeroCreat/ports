# Description: Import all existing versions of a program into CVS or Subversion.
#  cvs-importer automates the task of importing all past versions of
#  an existing project into CVS or Subversion, including automatically
#  removing generated files, creating .cvsignore files/svn:ignore properties,
#  and tagging each version. Thus, you can gain some of the advantages of
#  scm for the older versions that weren't actually developed in cvs/svn,
#  by having all the changes in the history.
