# Description: dbg
#  The dbg library is a set of C++ utilities to facilitate modern debugging
#  idioms. It has been designed to support defensive programming techniques
#  in modern C++ code. It integrates well with standard library usage and
#  has been carefully designed to be easy to write, easy to read and very
#  easy to use.
#  'dbg' provides various constraint checking utilities together with an
#  integrated error logging facility. These utilities can be enabled and
#  disabled at runtime, and in release builds, dbg library use can be
#  compiled away to nothing.
