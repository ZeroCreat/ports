# Description: A library that intends to make the coexistence of C++ and Lua more harmonious.
#  Diluculum is a library that intends to make the coexistence of C++ and Lua
#  more harmonious. In this regard, it offers essentially three "services":
#  a nice way to access data stored in a Lua interpreter; a not so bad way to
#  write functions in C++ and make them available to Lua; and a limited and
#  just barely usable way to register C++ classes and objects in a Lua state.
