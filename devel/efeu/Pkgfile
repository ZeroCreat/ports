# Description: EFEU is suitable for handling data cubes, which are especially useful for building data warehouses. It consists of a building system including mkmf (a xmkmf like Makefile generator), esh (a powerful C/C++ interpreter), efeudoc (a document generator with different output formats (LaTeX, HTML, roff, etc.)). EFEU has a huge set of C library core features, including robust memory allocation tools, functions to concatenate and copy strings with memory allocation, buffers for dynamically-growing strings and fields, data structures with reference counters and garbage collection, and file tools that allow you to specify pipes wherever a filename is expected and support automatic implementation of (de)compression filters (gzip) depending on filename extensions. It also includes a high-level interface to files, strings, and anything else you can read from or write to.
