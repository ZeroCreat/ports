# Description: An ELF binary-to-process comparison tool.
#  elfcmp compares running processes to the their respective binary image
#  to ensure that the process image in memory has not been tampered with
#  after execution. This is useful for general security auditing purposes
#  as other methods that rely strictly on checking disk image checksums are
#  not entirely reliable if only the process image is being tampered with.
