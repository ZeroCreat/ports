# Description: Lets you automate telnet, ftp, passwd, fsck, rlogin, tip, etc.
#  Expect is a tool for automating interactive applications such as telnet,
#  ftp, passwd, fsck, rlogin, tip, etc. Expect really makes this stuff
#  trivial. Expect is also useful for testing these same applications. And by
#  adding Tk, you can also wrap interactive applications in X11 GUIs. Expect
#  can make easy all sorts of tasks that are prohibitively difficult with
#  anything else. You will find that Expect is an absolutely invaluable
#  tool - using it, you will be able to automate tasks that you've never
#  even thought of before - and you'll be able to do this automation quickly
#  and easily.
