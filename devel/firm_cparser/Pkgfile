# Description: A recursive descent C99 compiler frontend.
#  cparser is a recursive descent C99 parser written in C99. It contains
#  a lexer, parser, constructs an AST, and does semantic analysis. It is
#  currently used as a frontend to the libFirm intermediate representation,
#  but can be used independently. It supports lots of GNU extensions:
#  enough to parse Linux/BSD system headers and compile typical C projects
#  with it. It is able to bootstrap itself, and compiles and runs the spec
#  CINT2000 without problems.
