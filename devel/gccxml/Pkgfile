# Description: XML output extension to GCC
#  There is one open-source C++ parser, the C++ front-end to GCC, which is
#  currently able to deal with the language in its entirety. The purpose
#  of the GCC-XML extension is to generate an XML description of a C++
#  program from GCC's internal representation. Since XML is easy to parse,
#  other development tools will be able to work with C++ programs without
#  the burden of a complicated C++ parser.
