# Description: A platform independent make processor.
#  iMake is a platform independent make processor written entirely
#  in Java for creating scalable enterprise solutions. Using iMake,
#  developers can easily create and maintain libraries, executables, and
#  object files from source files. iMake lets developers automate site and
#  program maintenance using makefiles which describe how the files depend
#  on each other and how to update a file when the files it depends on
#  change. iMake is particularly useful for projects that have many files,
#  since only those files that have changed are regenerated, achieving
#  this by looking at the date and time that each dependant file before
#  performing a operations. iMake features include platform independence,
#  a make facility, macro processor, user inference and target definitions,
#  multiple targets, conditional compilation, recursive expression evaluator,
#  command-line definitions, extensible search path, includes, and other
#  functionality found in professional make processors.
