# Description: Keeps track of the files created and modified by a process.
#  Installwatch is a simple utility which keeps track of which files are
#  created and modified during the installation of a new program. It's
#  fast and easy to use. It doesn't require a &quot;pre-install&quot;
#  phase because it monitors processes while they run. Installwatch works
#  with every dynamically linked ELF program, by intercepting system calls
#  that cause file system alterations.
