# Description: Tracks runtime library calls in dynamically-linked programs.
#  ltrace is a debugging program which runs a specified command until it
#  exits. While the command is executing, ltrace intercepts and records
#  the dynamic library calls which are called by the executed process and
#  the signals received by that process. It can also intercept and print
#  the system calls executed by the program. The program to be traced need
#  not be recompiled for this, so you can use it on binaries for which you
#  don't have the source handy. You should install ltrace if you need a
#  sysadmin tool for tracking the execution of processes.
