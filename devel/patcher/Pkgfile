# Description: A tool for quick creation of patches against a source tree.
#  Patcher is a tool for quick creation of patches against a project source
#  tree. Patcher functionality resembles a lightweight version control
#  system. It has no repository, and only controls differences between a
#  pristine version and a working copy.
