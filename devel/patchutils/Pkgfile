# Name: patchutils
# Description: Patchutils contains a collection of tools for manipulating
# patch files: interdiff, combinediff, flipdiff, filterdiff, fixcvsdiff,
# rediff, lsdiff, grepdiff, splitdiff, recountdiff, and unwrapdiff. You can
# use interdiff to create an incremental patch between two patches that are
# against a common source tree, combinediff for creating a cumulative diff
# from two incremental patches, and flipdiff to transpose two incremental
# patches. Filterdiff is for extracting or excluding patches from a patch
# set based on modified files matching shell wildcards. Lsdiff lists modified
# files in a patch. Rediff, recountdiff, and unwrapdiff correct hand-edited
# (or otherwise broken) patches.
