# Description: Pre Make
#  Pre Make Kit (PMK) aims to be a BSD alternative to GNU autoconf, GNU
#  libtool, and pkg-config. It uses data files instead of scripts to limit
#  the spreading of trojans in software packages. It's designed to be easy
#  to use for users and developers. For better portability and efficiency,
#  all of the components are written in C. Requirements are a POSIX system,
#  a C compiler, a POSIX shell, and a make tool.
