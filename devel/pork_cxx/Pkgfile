# Description: A  C++ parsing and rewriting tool chain.
#  Pork is a C++ parsing and rewriting tool chain. Its primary purpose is to
#  perform automated refactoring of large C++ codebases. The core of Pork
#  is a C++ parser that provides exact character positions for the start
#  and end of every AST node, as well as the set of macro expansions that
#  contain any location. This information allows C++ to be automatically
#  rewritten in a precise way. It could be used as a backend to support
#  Eclipse-style refactoring of C++ code.
