# Description: A framework for native XML programming.
#  RefleX is a Java tool that allows people that have no particular knowledge
#  of Java to write smart programs entirely in XML. The concepts of native
#  XML programming used in RefleX have been designed separately, so that
#  other implementations on other platforms/languages can be considered. As
#  the tags used are considered "active", the underlying concepts have been
#  named "Active Tags". Programming in XML allows developers to efficiently
#  produce batch scripts as well as Web applications. With Active Tags,
#  you can dramatically decrease the number of lines you have to code.
