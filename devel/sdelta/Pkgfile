# Description: A diff/patch utility for source tarballs.
#  sdelta analyzes two files and outputs the difference. It applies the
#  difference to the first of the original files to construct a bit for bit
#  clone of the second file. It is optimized for use with source tarballs,
#  and also contains sdreq, the client for the Public Patch Repository,
#  PPR. The PPR generates on demand source upgrade and downgrade patches
#  for over a quarter of a million version specific source tarballs. By
#  using sdreq you can acquire new source tarballs from the PPR several
#  times faster and with only 10% of the downloading that you currently do.
