# Description: shipper is a power distribution tool for developers with
# multiple projects who do frequent releases. It automates the tedious
# process of shipping a software release to several standard places,
# including ibiblio, the Red Hat submission directory, and your own
# hosted website. It also knows how to post a release announcement
# to freshmeat.net via freshmeat-submit. Two auxiliary tools, buildrpms
# and rpm2lsm, build RPMs and generate LSM files from them respectively.
