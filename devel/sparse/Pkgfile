# Description: A semantic parser of source files.
#  Sparse is a semantic parser of source files. It's neither a compiler
#  (although it could be used as a front-end for one) nor a preprocessor
#  (although it contains a preprocessing phase). It is meant to be a small,
#  simple, easy to use library. Its function is to create a semantic parse
#  tree for some arbitrary user for further analysis. It's not a tokenizer,
#  nor is it a generic context-free parser. Context (semantics) is what
#  it's all about: figuring out not just what the grouping of tokens are,
#  but what the types are that the grouping implies.
