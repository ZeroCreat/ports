# Description: Interactive policy generation for system calls.
#  Systrace enforces system call policies for applications by constraining
#  the application's access to the system. The policy is generated
#  interactively. Operations not covered by the policy raise an alarm,
#  allowing the user to refine the currently configured policy. After a
#  policy has been sufficiently constructed, further alarms often indicate
#  security problems. Policies can also be generated automatically for
#  sandboxing purposes.
