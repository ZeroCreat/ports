# Description: Enhanced wiki and issue tracking system for software development projects
#  Trac uses a minimalistic approach to web-based software project
#  management. Our mission; to help developers write great software while
#  staying out of the way. Trac should impose as little as possible on a
#  team's established development process and policies. Trac can use SQLite,
#  PostgreSQL and MySQL backends. The preferred and easier to use is SQLite.
