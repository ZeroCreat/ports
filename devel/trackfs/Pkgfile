# Description: A small program that tracks file system changes.
#  Trackfs is a small program that tracks file system changes made by another
#  program (or group of programs). It is similar to "installwatch", but works
#  quite differently. While installwatch uses LD_PRELOAD to intercept library
#  functions like open() and unlink(), trackfs runs the child program(s)
#  with tracing enabled and tracks the system calls they make.
