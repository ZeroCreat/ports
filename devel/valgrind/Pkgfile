# Description: A memory debugger.
#  Valgrind is a tool that helps you find memory management problems in
#  programs. When a program is run under Valgrind's supervision, all reads
#  and writes of memory are checked, and calls to malloc/new/free/delete
#  are intercepted. As a result, Valgrind can detect problems such as use
#  of uninitialized memory, reading/writing of memory after it has been
#  freed, reading/writing off the end of malloced blocks, reading/writing
#  inappropriate areas on the stack, memory leaks in which pointers
#  to malloced blocks are lost forever, passing of uninitialized and/or
#  unaddressable memory to system calls, and mismatched use of malloc/new/new
#  [] vs. free/delete/delete [].
