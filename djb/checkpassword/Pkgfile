# Description: Password-checking tool
#  checkpassword provides a simple, uniform password-checking interface to
#  all root applications. It is suitable for use by applications such as
#  login, ftpd, and pop3d. There are checkpassword-compatible tools that
#  support alternate password databases, secret login names, long passwords,
#  subaccounts, one-time passwords, detailed accounting, and many other
#  features. Applications that use the checkpassword interface will work
#  with all of these tools. Several tools have been specifically designed
#  to support POP toasters.
