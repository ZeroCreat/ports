# Description: Enlightenment DR17 file chunk reading/writing library
#  Eet is a tiny library designed to write an arbitary set of chunks of data
#  to a file and optionally compress each chunk (very much like a zip file)
#  and allow fast random-access reading of the file later on. It does not
#  do zip as zip itself has more complexity than we need, and it was much
#  simpler to implement this once here.
#  It's small, fast, and does a job. It's heavily commented and fully
#  documented.
