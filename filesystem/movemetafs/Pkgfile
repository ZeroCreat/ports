# Description: A searchable file metadata store.
#  movemetafs is a searchable filesystem metadata store for Linux that lets
#  users tag local files (including image, video, audio, and text files) by
#  simply moving the files to a special folder using any file manager. It
#  also lets users find files by tags using a boolean search query. The
#  original files (and their names) are kept intact. movemetafs doesn't
#  have its own user interface, but it is usable with any file manager.
