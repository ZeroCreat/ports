# Name: Nemesis Utilities System
# Description: a cross-platform C++ application development framework which
# focus on the development of network applications, non-gui applications, cgi
# scripts, database applications and any kind of application that needs
# interoperability. NUS is very modular and its functionality is separated in
# modules, as such making it easy to maintain, debug and deploy. The NUS
# Library was greatly inspired in other libraries I have been working on the
# latest years like, for example, Trolltech's QT.
# It's also very important to note that NUS is Free Software, released under
# the LGPL, and it will remain so.
