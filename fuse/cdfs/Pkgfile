# Description: A filesystem that exports all tracks on a CD as normal files.
#  CDfs is a file system for Linux systems that `exports' all tracks and
#  boot images on a CD as normal files. These files can then be mounted
#  (e.g. for ISO and boot images), copied, played (audio tracks), etc. The
#  primary goal for developing this file system was to `unlock' information
#  in old ISO sessions. The file system also allows you to access data on
#  faulty multi session disks, e.g. disks with multiple single sessions
#  instead of a multi session.
