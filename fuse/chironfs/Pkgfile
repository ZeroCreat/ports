# Description: A FUSE based filesystem that implements replication at the filesystem level like RAID 1 does at the device level.
# The replicated filesystem may be of any kind you want; the only requisite is that you mount it. There is no need for special configuration files; the setup is as simple as one mount command (or one line in fstab).

# Maintainer: Roman Senn <rs@adfinis.com>
# Depends on: libc6, libfuse2
