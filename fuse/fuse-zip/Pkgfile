# Description: ZIP archive mounter.
#  fuse-zip is a FUSE file system to navigate, extract, create, and modify
#  ZIP archives based on libzip implemented in C++. You can work with ZIP
#  archives as real directories. Unlike KIO or Gnome VFS, it can be used in
#  any application without modifications. Unlike other FUSE filesystems,
#  fuse-zip provides write support for ZIP archives. Also, fuse-zip is
#  faster than other known implementations on large archives with many files.
