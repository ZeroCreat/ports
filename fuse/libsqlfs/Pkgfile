# Description: A POSIX style file system on top of an SQLite database
#
# Libsqlfs is a library used in conjunction with SQLite
# that allows applications to put an entire read/write file system into
# a relational database as a single file in the host filesystem. Such a
# filesystem-in-a-file can easily be moved around, backed up, or restored
# as a single file. The filesystem can also be accessed as individual
# files through FUSE (File System in User Space). This provides great
# flexibility and convenience. File system accesses can be batched into
# atomic transactions (either all the updates are done, or none of them
# are). Libsqlfs was created as part of the ACCESS
# URL: http://www.nongnu.org/libsqlfs/
# Maintainer: Roman Senn <rs@adfinis.com>
# Depends on: libc6, libsqlite3-0, xulrunner-1.9
