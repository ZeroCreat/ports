# Description: Encrypted FUSE based filesystem
# MetFS is a filesystem software in userspace that is FUSE based, encrypted,
# dynamic sized (increase when new data added, decrease when data removed),
# single file when it's unmounted and very fast.
# No data stored on an encrypted partition can be read without using the
# correct password. Until decrypted, a MetFS partition appears to be
# nothing more than a series of meaningless data.
# The .MFS file extension is associated with the MetFS program but it is
# not required; these files can have any file extension or no file
# extension. The program does not care. MetFS 's been written in C language
# for performance reasons; proved to be running on Linux and FreeBSD.
#
# Features:
#  - MetFS partitions are visible only to the user who mounted them.
#    No other users (including root) can view the filesystem contents.
#  - MetFS partition looks like a single file when it's unmounted.
#  - Clear version of the user password is never written to disk.
#  - RC4 stream cipher algorithm is used.
#  - MD5 hash algorithm is preferred.
#  - Clear data never stored in anywhere.
#  - Writing 1.6 GB sized data in ext3 filesystem is just 16 seconds faster
#    than MetFS.
#  - Faster and more secure string functions of OpenBSD and D.J.B are used.
#  - .mfs is official file extension of MetFS.
