# Description: GNOME keyring services (daemon and tools)
#  gnome-keyring is a daemon in the session, similar to ssh-agent, and
#  other applications can use it to store passwords and other sensitive
#  information.
#  The program can manage several keyrings, each with its own master
#  password, and there is also a session keyring which is never stored to
#  disk, but forgotten when the session ends.
