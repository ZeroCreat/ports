# Description: A powerful object-oriented display - runtime files
#  The canvas widget is a powerful and extensible object-oriented display
#  engine. A GnomeCanvasItem is a GtkObject representing some element of the
#  display, such as an image, a rectangle, an ellipse, or some text. You can
#  refer to this architecture as structured graphics; the canvas lets you
#  deal with graphics in terms of items, rather than an undifferentiated grid
#  of pixels. A powerful object-oriented display - runtime files The canvas
