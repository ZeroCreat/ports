# Description: GNOME 2.2 print architecture User Interface - runtime files
#  The goals of this architecture include:
#  * Absolutely uncompromised output quality
#  * Speed, memory efficiency, and other related performance goals
#  * Ability to work smoothly with Postscript printers, fonts, and other
#  resources
#  * A screen display derived from the Canvas
#  * An extension path for a wide variety of Unicode scripts
#  * An extension path for a richer set of graphics operators than Postscript
#  supports, especially transparency
#  * To make life as easy as possible for application developers
#  This package contains runtime files.
