# Description: A C++ library for visualizing mathematical vectors.
#  Libgvectors is a C++ library for visualizing three dimensional
#  mathematical vectors, providing three fundamental classes for achieving
#  its purpose. It makes as few assumptions as possible about the graphics
#  library used to draw vectors on a screen and is not bound to any
#  particular graphics library.
