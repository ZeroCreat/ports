# Description: A library for creating trees of CORBA Interface Definition Language files.
#  libIDL is a library for creating trees of CORBA Interface Definition
#  Language (IDL) files, which is a specification for defining portable
#  interfaces. libIDL was initially written for ORBit (the ORB from the
#  GNOME project, and the primary means of libIDL distribution). However,
#  the functionality was designed to be as reusable and portable as possible.
