# Description: GNU Bison
#  Bison is a general-purpose parser generator that converts an annotated
#  context-free grammar into an LALR(1) or GLR parser for that grammar. Once
#  you are proficient with Bison, you can use it to develop a wide range of
#  language parsers, from those used in simple desk calculators to complex
#  programming languages.
#  Bison is upward compatible with Yacc: all properly-written Yacc grammars
#  ought to work with Bison with no change. Anyone familiar with Yacc should
#  be able to use Bison with little trouble. You need to be fluent in C or
#  C++ programming in order to use Bison.
