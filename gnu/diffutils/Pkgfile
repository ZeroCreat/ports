# Description: GNU Diffutils
#  A group of utilities that displays difference between and among text
#  files. 'diff' outputs the difference between two files in any of several
#  formats. If the files are identical, it normally produces no ouput;
#  if they are binary (non-text) it normally reports only that they are
#  different. 'cmp' shows the offsets and files numbers where two files
#  differ; it can also show, side by side, all the characters that differ
#  between the two files. 'sdiff' merges two files interactively. 'diff3'
#  shows differences among three files. If two people have made independent
#  changes to a common original, diff3 reports that difference between the
#  original and the two changed versions, and can produce a merged file
#  that contains both persons' changes along with warnings about conflicts.
