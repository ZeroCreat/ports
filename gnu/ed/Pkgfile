# Description: An 8-bit clean, POSIX-compliant line editor.
#  GNU ed is an 8-bit clean implementation of the POSIX line-oriented text
#  editor. Ed is the "standard" text editor in the sense that it is the
#  original editor for Unix, and thus widely available. For most purposes,
#  however, it is superseded by full-screen editors such as GNU Emacs or
#  GNU Moe.
