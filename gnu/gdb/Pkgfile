# Description: GNU Gdb
#  GDB lets you to see what is going on `inside' another program while it
#  executes--or what another program was doing at the moment it crashed.
#  GDB lets you start your program, specify anything that might affect
#  its behavior, make it stop on specified conditions, examine what has
#  happened when your program has stopped, and change things in it, so you
#  can experiment with correcting the effects of one bug and go on to learn
#  about another.
