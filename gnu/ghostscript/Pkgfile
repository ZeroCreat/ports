# Description: An interpreter for the PostScript (TM) language.
#  Ghostscript is a processor for PostScript and PDF files. It can rasterize
#  these files to a wide variety of printers, devices for screen preview,
#  and image file formats. Since applications tend to prepare pages for
#  printing in a high-level format such as PostScript, most Unix users with
#  low-level bitmap printers, such as inkjets, use GhostScript as part of
#  the printing process. In addition, Ghostscript is capable of converting
#  PostScript files, functionality comparable to Adobe Acrobat Distiller, but
#  on the command line. In addition, Ghostscript is used for file import and
#  viewing by a great many other applications, including xv, ImageMagick,
#  gimp, and xdvi. Several GUI wrappers for viewing PostScript and PDF
#  files exist, including GSview, ghostview, gv, ggv, and kghostview. This
#  is far from a comprehensive list.
