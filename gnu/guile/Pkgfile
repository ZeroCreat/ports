# Description: GNU Guile
#  An implementation of the Scheme programming language built to be
#  used as an extension language. It's a library you can link into
#  your programs. Your program has full access to the interpreter's data
#  structure, so you can extend Guile with your own primitives, datatypes,
#  and syntax, and tailor the language to your application.
#  It also lets more people use your language, as they needn't learn the
#  internals of your app. They just need to understand the language and
#  the primitives you've provided, and they can trade and share ideas by
#  passing around scripts without you.
#  It has arrays, lists, modules, objects, first class functions, and
#  garbage collection.
