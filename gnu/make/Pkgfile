# Package: make
# Version: 4:
# Section: devel
# Description: GNU make
#  Make examines a set of related files, determines which of them are out
#  of date, and runs just the commands necessary to bring them back up to
#  date. Make is typically used to compile and link programs, but it can
#  be useful in many other situations as well.
#  Make reads a file called a 'makefile' to learn how the files in your
#  program are put together. It may also contain rules to install the
#  product, clear up the workspace, generate distribution packages, or other
#  tasks. When you write a program, you should also create a makefile for
#  it so that it is possible to use Make to build and install it.
