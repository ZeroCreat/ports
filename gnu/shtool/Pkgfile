# Description: GNU Portable Shell Tool.
#  GNU shtool is a compilation of small but very stable and portable shell
#  scripts into a single shell tool. All ingredients were in successful use
#  over many years in various free software projects. The compiled shtool
#  program is intended to be used inside the source tree of free software
#  packages. There it can overtake various (usually non-portable) tasks
#  related to the building and installation of an free software package.
