# Description: A POSIX packaging implementation with useful extensions.
#  Swbis aims to implement the POSIX packaging standard with useful
#  extensions. Working utilities include swpackage(8), swverify(8),
#  swcopy(8), and swinstall(8). GPG/PGP signing and verification of tar
#  archives is supported as well as an installed software catalog form that
#  allows direct use of gpg(1) for verification of the GPG signature in the
#  package database. swcopy and swinstall are network transparent by direct
#  use of SSH and support multiple SSH hops for easy access to hosts behind
#  a firewall. Neither has to be installed on the remote target host.
