# Description: GNU Wget
#  Wget is a network utility to retrieve files from the Web using
#  http and ftp, the two most widely used Internet protocols. It works
#  non-interactively, so it will work in the background, after having logged
#  off. The program supports recursive retrieval of web-authoring pages
#  as well as ftp sites-- you can use wget to make mirrors of archives and
#  home pages or to travel the Web like a WWW robot.
#  Wget works particularly well with slow or unstable connections
#  by continuing to retrieve a document until the document is fully
#  downloaded. Re-getting files from where it left off works on servers
#  (both http and ftp) that support it. Both http and ftp retrievals can
#  be time stamped, so wget can see if the remote file has changed since
#  the last retrieval and automatically retrieve the new version if it has.
#  Wget supports proxy servers; this can lighten the network load, speed
#  up retrieval, and provide access behind firewalls.
