# Description: GNU Which
#  Which prints out the full path of the executables that bash(1) would
#  execute when the passed program names would have been entered on the
#  shell prompt. It uses the exact same algorithm as bash. Tildes and a dot
#  in the PATH are now expanded to the full path by default. Options allow
#  users to print "~/*" or "./*" and/or to print all executables that match
#  any directory in the PATH.
