# Description: Libart is a library for high-performance 2D graphics.
#              It supports a very powerful imaging model, basically
#              the same as SVG and the Java 2D API. It includes all
#              PostScript imaging operations, and adds antialiasing
#              and alpha-transparency. It is also highly tuned for
#              incremental rendering. It contains data structures
#              and algorithms suited to rapid, precise computation
#              of Region of Interest, and a two-phase rendering
#              pipeline optimized for interactive display.
