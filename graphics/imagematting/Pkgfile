# Description: A tool for cutting out objects in photos using an alpha-matting technique.
# Image matting tool cuts out objects in photos using an alpha-matting
# technique. While clear cuts can be found for all objects that are
# clearly separated from their environment, objects with fuzzy borders
# and semi-transparent areas don't have a clear outline. The tool creates
# an alpha channel that defines the degree to which the background shines
# through the foreground for every pixel. The background color can then
# be subtracted. The user defines a rough boundary of an object with a
# large brush and a high-quality segmentation is generated. Problematic
# areas can be edited manually.
