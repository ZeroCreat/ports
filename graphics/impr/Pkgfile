# Description: A small and fast image processing library with a simple API.
# impr is a small and fast image processing library with a simple API. Its
# functions work mostly on 8-bit image channels, which means that main type
# is just (u8 *) or (b8 *) for grey and binary images respectively. It was
# intended for use in real-time processing, so functions are optimized for
# speed. It supports segmentation (4 and 8-connected), flood fill, filling
# object holes, downscaling and upscaling (with linear interpolation) by
# an integer factor, generic implementations of dilate and erode (+image
# open and close), color space conversions between HSVRGB and YRGRGB,
# convolutions with Roberts and 2x2 low-pass filters, and common binary
# image operations.
