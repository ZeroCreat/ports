# Description: A program for content-aware image resizing.
#  Arachne is program that implements Avidan and Shamir's seam carving
#  technique for content-aware image resizing. It allows realtime, fluid
#  image resizing using this fascinating technique. Seam carving works by
#  removing the "boring bits" from an image, so it can change the aspect
#  ratio of many images without changing the shape of the objects inside.
