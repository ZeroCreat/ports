# Description: GStreamer libraries from the "base" set
# GStreamer is a streaming media framework, based on graphs of filters
# which operate on media data.  Applications using this library can do
# anything from real-time sound processing to playing videos, and just
# about anything else media-related.  Its plugin-based architecture means
# that new data types or processing capabilities can be added simply by
# installing new plug-ins.
#  This package contains libraries from the "base" set, an essential
# exemplary set of elements.
