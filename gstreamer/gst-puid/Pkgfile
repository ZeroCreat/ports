# Description: GstPUID is a GStreamer element that allows for fingerprint-based detection of music files using MusicDNS/MusicIP and Musicbrainz. It allows for detection of the track's artist and title based on the audio data only. It works with any file format that is supported by GStreamer. It is geared towards developers; an example application is included that should make clear how the element is to be used.
