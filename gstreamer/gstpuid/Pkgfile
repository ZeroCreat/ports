# Description: A GST plugin for fingerprint-based detection of music file metadata.
#  GstPUID is a GStreamer element that allows for fingerprint-based detection
#  of music files using MusicDNS/MusicIP and Musicbrainz. It allows for
#  detection of the track's artist and title based on the audio data only. It
#  works with any file format that is supported by GStreamer. It is geared
#  towards developers; an example application is included that should make
#  clear how the element is to be used.
