# Description: A C/C++ compiler/debugger optimized for maximum performance on Intel processors.
#  The Intel C++ Compiler for Linux is a full fledged C/C++ compiler and
#  debugger suite. Its aim is to provide outstanding performance for all
#  Intel 32-bit and 64-bit processors, while not requiring the need for
#  porting applications from other compilers. It provides optimization
#  technology, threaded application support, and features to take advantage
#  of Hyper-Threading technology. It is substantially source and object code
#  compatible with GNU C, providing fullest compatibility with GCC and G++
#  3.x/4.x both in terms of code and of API. It is thereby also easy to
#  integrate with existing development environments.
