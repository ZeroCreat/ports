# Description: Simple, extensible, embeddable programming language
#  Lua is a powerful, light-weight programming language designed for
#  extending applications. The language engine is accessible as a library,
#  having a C API which allows the application to exchange data with Lua
#  programs and also to extend Lua with C functions. Lua is also used as
#  a general-purpose, stand-alone language through the simple command line
#  interpreter provided.
#  This package contains the Lua command line interpreter and bytecode
#  compiler. Install it if you are developing or using Lua scripts.
