# Description: An extensible extension language
#  Lua is a programming language originally designed for extending
#  applications, but also frequently used as a general-purpose, stand-alone
#  language. It combines simple procedural syntax (similar to Pascal) with
#  powerful data description constructs based on associative arrays and
#  extensible semantics. It is dynamically typed, interpreted from bytecodes,
#  and has automatic memory management, making it ideal for configuration,
#  scripting, and rapid prototyping. It is implemented as a small library
#  of C functions, written in ANSI C, and compiles unmodified in all
#  known platforms. The implementation goals are simplicity, efficiency,
#  portability, and low embedding cost. It has been used on games such as
#  Vendetta, FarCry, Homeworld2, Painkiller, and World of Warcraft.
