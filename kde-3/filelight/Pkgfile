# Description: A compact and recursive graphical representation of your disk usage.
#  Filelight graphically represents a file system as a set of concentric
#  segmented rings (or nested piecharts), aiming to show where disk space
#  is being used. Segments expand from the center, representing files and
#  directories. The size of segments is proportional to the size of the files
#  they represent. Directories have child segments which represent the files
#  they contain. Filelight performs a similar function to the command line
#  tool du, but all the information is shown in a compact graphical fashion.
