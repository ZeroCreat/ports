# Description: versatile and easy to use audio player for KDE
#  Amarok tries to be a little different, providing a simple drag and drop
#  interface that really makes playlist handling easy.
#  Features include:
#  - rapid playlist creation, with drag and drop from a directory view
#  - nice playlist browser for your existing playlists (PLS or M3U formats)
#  - collection-indexing support, for smart browsing and playlist creation
#  - possibility of accessing media via kioslaves, allowing you to play
#  via smb:// or fish:// (normal streams are of course supported)
#  - inline ID3 tag editing, capable of retrieving tags via MusicBrainz
#  - album cover support: automatically displays album covers from the
#  filesystem, or downloaded on the fly
#  - miscellaneous audio effects, including crossfading
#  - easy bindable global shortcuts, rich DCOP interface
#  - On-Screen Display (OSD), on track change or at keypress
#  - iPod and iRiver support
#  - Last.fm stream playing support (if ruby is installed)
#  - Track "mood" display (requires moodbar package installed)
#  Support for libvisual visualization plugins is also compiled in (you
#  need to have libvisual-0.4-plugins installed to be able to use it).
