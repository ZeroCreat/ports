# Description: A script that downloads, builds, and installs KDE from its source repository.
#  kdesvn-build is a script to automate the process of downloading, building,
#  and installing KDE from its Subversion source repository. It supports
#  many advanced features such as partial checkout/build of a module,
#  the unsermake build system, incremental make, module checkouts using
#  Subversion snapshots from the kdesvn-build.kde.org site, and repeatable
#  builds. Many options are available, and they apply to every module
#  by default, but most options can be overridden on a module-by-module
#  basis. Every command it executes is logged.
