# Description: FreeDesktop.org shared MIME database and spec
#  This is the shared MIME-info database from the X Desktop Group. It is
#  required by any program complying to the Shared MIME-Info Database spec,
#  which is also included in this package.
#  At this time ROX and GNOME use this database. KDE is expected to follow
#  soon, and hopefully others too.
