# Description: A cross-platform, open-source make system
#  CMake is used to control the software compilation process using
#  simple platform and compiler independent configuration files. CMake
#  generates native makefiles and workspaces that can be used in the
#  compiler environment of your choice. CMake is quite sophisticated: it is
#  possible to support complex environments requiring system configuration,
#  pre-processor generation, code generation, and template instantiation.
#  CMake was developed by Kitware as part of the NLM Insight Segmentation and
#  Registration Toolkit project. The ASCI VIEWS project also provided support
#  in the context of their parallel computation environment. Other sponsors
#  include the Insight, VTK, and VXL open source software communities.
