# Description: Bandlimited wavetable-based oscillator plugins for LADSPA hosts
#  BLOP comprises a set of LADSPA plugins that generate bandlimited sawtooth,
#  square, variable pulse and slope-variable triangle waves, for use in
#  LADSPA aware audio applications, principally as components of a modular
#  synthesis network.
#  They are wavetable based, and are designed to produce output with harmonic
#  content as high as possible over a wide pitch range.
#  Additionally, there are a few extra plugins to assist in building
#  synthesis networks, like a analogue-type sequencer, sync-square and
#  ADSR envelope.
