# Description: A cross platform C++ application framework.
#  The Visual Component Framework is a cross platform C++ application
#  framework that offers a modern, clean architecture. It is divided into
#  three major libraries. The FoundationKit provides services such as
#  file access, streams, threads, synchronization primitives, and advanced
#  RTTI features. The GraphicsKit includes classes for working with both
#  image and vector graphics, and has built in support for the Anti-Grain
#  Graphics library. The ApplicationKit provides GUI controls, use of the
#  Model-View-Control pattern, property and component editors, undo/redo
#  support, drag-and-drop, clipboard services, application resources,
#  and UI metrics and policy managers.
