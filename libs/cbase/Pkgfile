# Description: A C library for UNIX systems software development.
#  cbase is a C library that simplifies systems software development
#  on UNIX. The library includes functions for memory management, string
#  parsing, sub-process execution, filesystem traversal, I/O, interfaces to
#  IPC mechanisms including pseudo-terminals, shared memory, semaphores,
#  and other facilities. It also has implementations of common dynamic
#  data structures like linked lists, queues, stacks, and hash tables,
#  a real-time scheduler similar in functionality to the cron daemon, and
#  high-level APIs to Berkeley sockets and other networking functions. Full
#  API documentation is included.
