# Description: A configuration file parser library.
#  libConfuse is a configuration file parser library written in C. It's
#  goal is to be easy to use and quick to integrate into existing code. It
#  supports sections and (lists of) values (strings, integers, floats,
#  booleans, or other sections), as well as some other features (such as
#  single/double-quoted strings, environment variable expansion, functions,
#  and nested include statements). It makes it very easy to add configuration
#  file capability to a program using a simple API.
