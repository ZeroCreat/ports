# Description: A lightweight cross-platform C++ library.
#  CrissCross is a small cross-platform C++ library for console and file
#  I/O, CPU identification (CPUID), hashing (MD2, MD4, MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256,
#  SHA-512, Tiger), sockets (TCP and UDP only currently), and data structures
#  (LList, DArray, RedBlackTree, AVLTree, SplayTree, etc). It is designed
#  to run on Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, Mac OS X, and even
#  the Nintendo DS. Other platforms may become supported upon request. The
#  main idea is to provide the ability to write a program using identical
#  calls on the major platforms without needing to rewrite code.
