# Description: Transfer vector for app.so linkage on Linux/x86
# Elfvector is a package for generating and using a transfer vector for
# subroutine linkage between an ELF executable and an ELF shared library
# under Linux on x86, in order to save space and application startup
# time. At runtime, only the name of the vector is looked up dynamically, no
# matter how many symbols are used from the vector. Elfvector also includes
# vectool for managing groups of shared libraries at fixed addresses.
