# Description: A generic data structures library for C programmers.
#  The Generic Data Structures Library (GDSL) is a collection of routines
#  for generic data structures manipulation. It is a portable and re-entrant
#  library fully written from scratch in pure ANSI C. It is designed to
#  offer C programmers access to common data structures with powerful
#  algorithms and hidden implementation. Available structures are lists,
#  queues, stacks, hash tables, binary trees, binary search trees, red-black
#  trees, 2D arrays, permutations, and heaps.
