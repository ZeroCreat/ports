# Description: Viewer for the International Beacon Project
#  Ibp shows which of the beacons of the International Beacon Project is
#  transmitting now. The user is presented with a list of Beacons with the
#  current beacon highlighted. In a separate graphical window the position
#  and short/long path to the beacon can be seen.
#  The list can be viewed in either single or multiband mode, a Maidenhead
#  locator, when used as an argument, shows distance and azimuth to each
#  beacon.
#  You will need an accurate clock because the beacons transmit at 10
#  second intervals.
