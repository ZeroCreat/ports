# Description: A C++ library of mathematical, signal processing, and communication routines.
#  IT++ is a C++ library of mathematical, signal processing, and
#  communication classes and functions. Its main use is in simulation
#  of communication systems or for performing research in the area of
#  communications. The kernel of the library consists of generic vector
#  and matrix classes and lots of functions for vectors and matrices. Such
#  a kernel makes the IT++ library similar to MATLAB or GNU Octave.
