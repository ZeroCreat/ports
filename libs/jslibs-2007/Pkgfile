# Package: jslibs
# Description: standalone JavaScript development runtime environment with general purpose native libraries
#  jslibs is a standalone JavaScript development runtime environment for
#  using JavaScript as a general-purpose scripting language.
#  .
#  jslibs uses SpiderMonkey library that is Gecko's JavaScript engine
#  (SpiderMonkey is used in various Mozilla products, including Firefox).
#  .
#  jslibs provides a set of native modules that contains various general
#  purpose classes and functions.
#  .
#  Some of these modules are simple wrappers for familiar libraries such as:
#  zlib, SQLite, FastCGI, NSPR [(Netscape Portable Runtime)] , ODE [(Open
#  Dynamics Engine)] , libpng, libjpeg, librsvg, SDL, libiconv, OpenGL,
#  OpenAL, ogg vorbis, libTomCrypt, libffi [(Foreign function interface)] ,
#  ...
#  .
#  Other modules provide tools for enhancing JavaScript programming : Print(),
#  Load(), Exec(), Seal(), Expand(), Buffer class, Blob class, Sandbox class,
#  ...
#  .
#  The jslibs distribution comes with a small standalone command line access
#  program (jshost) that can be used to run JavaScript files. Note that the
#  modules are quite independent from jshost and can be used in any project
#  that embeds SpiderMonkey. A Windows binary (without console) is also
#  available (jswinhost).
