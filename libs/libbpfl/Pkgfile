# Description: A C++ library for building Bayesian Filters.
# Bayesian Pattern Filtering Library is a general purpose library designed
# for building Bayesian Filters. Its primary purpose is to provide an
# easy-to-use interface to allow the building of Bayesian filters regardless
# of the data being analyzed. A user will only need to provide a tokenizer,
# hash function, and comparison function in order to build a Filter.
