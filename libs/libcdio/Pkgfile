# Description: A CD-ROM read and control library with an ISO 9660 library, cdparanoia, and MMC.
#  The GNU Compact Disc Input and Control library encapsulates CD-ROM
#  reading and control for applications wishing to be oblivious to the OS-
#  and device-dependent properties of a CD-ROM. It provides an API for access
#  to SCSI-MMC (multimedia commands) and support for CD image types like
#  BIN/CUE, cdrdao's TOC, and Nero's NRG, which gives applications using the
#  library the ability to read disc images as though they were CDs. ISO-9660
#  filesystem support is included, as are utility programs for displaying CD
#  and CD-ROM drive information, reading the blocks of a CD, and extracting
#  files from an ISO-9660 filesytem image. cdparanoia is also included.
