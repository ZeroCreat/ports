# Description: A network programming interface for libevent.
#  libevnet provides a suite of interfaces useful in network
#  applications. The API includes a buffered I/O interface, connect(2)
#  and accept(2) analogues, a fully featured DNS lookup package, thread
#  pools, and transparent OpenSSL integration. Using libevent as the
#  poll-select-epoll-kqueue-/dev/poll event loop, all interfaces express
#  the traditional Unix non-blocking I/O paradigm for the construction of
#  high-performance applications.
