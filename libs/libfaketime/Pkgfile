# Description: A program that changes the system time just for selected programs.
#  FTPL (FakeTime Preload Library, aka libfaketime) intercepts various
#  system library calls and tricks programs of your choice into seeing a
#  faked system time without having to change the time system-wide. This can
#  be used for running legacy software with Y2K bugs, testing software for
#  year-2038 compliance, debugging time-related issues such as expired SSL
#  certificates, and using software that ceases to run outside a certain time
#  frame. The faked time can be specified either absolutely or relative to
#  the real current time, and optionally also affects file timestamps. The
#  faked clock continues to run, but can optionally be frozen, slowed
#  down, or made faster. A wrapper script "faketime" simplifies the usage,
#  similar to tools such as fakechroot.
