# Description: Original GNOME HTTP client library - run-time kit
#  The HTTP protocol is the protocol that is the underlying transport
#  mechanism for the modern world wide web. The protocol is well documented
#  and widely implemented. While the use of the protocol is generally
#  associated with the web, its uses can be extended to many other areas
#  where a stateless, transactional protocol may be appropriate. . The
#  original GNOME HTTP library was designed to be simple and easy to use
#  while still allowing one to get one's feet wet at the protocol layer if
#  needed. It was also designed with graphical, non-threaded applications
#  in mind. One should be able to use the library in an application and
#  never block waiting to send or receive data to a remote server. The
#  main thread of execution should always be available to refresh its
#  display. . This library is fully compliant with HTTP 1.1 as defined in
#  the draft 5 update of RFC 2068.
