# Description: A C protocol library for memcached and assorted command line tools.
# libmemcached is a C client library for interfacing to a memcached
# server. It has been designed to be light on memory usage, thread safe and
# to provide full access to server side methods. It also implements several
# command line tools: memcat, memflush, memrm, memstat, and memslap (for
# load generation). The library has been designed to allow for different
# hashing methods on keys, partitioning by keys, and to use consistent
# hashing for distribution.
