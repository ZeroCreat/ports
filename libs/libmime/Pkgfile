# Description: A streaming event MIME message parser.
#  libmime is a MIME parser in the same vein as Expat, the stream-oriented
#  XML parser. As input is fed to the parser, events are generated which an
#  application can catch by registering event handlers. Such events include
#  the Unix From_ line, start of entity, end of entity, entity boundary,
#  header, end of headers, and body. libmime supports MIME message editing
#  through a delta mechanism. Edit contexts are instantiated and changes
#  applied to specific contexts. Edit contexts can then be expressed in
#  standard unified diff format which, when applied to the input source
#  stream, will result in the new message.
