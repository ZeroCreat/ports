# Description: Verify and parse RFC822 addresses in your C++ application.
#  librfc822 provides application developers with a complete parser for
#  RFC822 addresses. Not only can you use the library to verify that RFC822
#  addresses are syntactically correct, you can also have an address split
#  up into its semantic parts, what is needed when deciding where to route an
#  address to, etc. What is quite unique is that librfc822 does indeed parse
#  all address types allowed by the standard. That includes such weird things
#  as "address groups" or addresses with whitespace and comments throw in.
