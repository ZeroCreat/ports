# Name: LibStroke - a stroke translation library
# Description: LibStroke is a stroke translation library. Strokes are motions
# of the mouse that can be interpreted by a program as a command. Strokes are
# used extensively in CAD programs. I fell in love with them when I was using
# the CAD tools that use a stroke interface to select tools or perform actions.
# I wrote this library so that others can see how useful strokes can be and so
# that more programs take advantage of this extremely natural human-computer
# interface.
