# Description: Library for writing single instance application
#  Unique is a library for writing single instance application. If you launch
#  a single instance application twice, the second instance will either
#  just quit or will send a message to the running instance. Unique makes
#  it easy to write this kind of applications, by providing a base class,
#  taking care of all the IPC machinery needed to send messages to a running
#  instance, and also handling the startup notification side. Unique aims
#  to replace the BaconMessageConnection code that has been copied by many
#  projects and the code using Bonobo and D-Bus. As of GNOME 2.26, Unique
#  is a GNOME blessed external dependency.
