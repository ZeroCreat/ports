# Description: A C++ library that expands "variables" in text buffers.
#  libvarexp is a C++ library that allows its users to detach any kind of
#  information from the representation of that information by providing a
#  simple-to-use but powerful text-template mechanism. It offers application
#  developers two functions that parse "variable" expressions in text buffers
#  and replace them with the variable's contents. Additionally, the enduser
#  has numerous ways not only to insert variables into his template files
#  but to modify the variables contents on the fly, do full-blown regular
#  expression search-and-replaces, or loop over the contents of arrays of
#  variables. These variables are not limited to "environment variables". The
#  programmer is free to provide a callback function to libvarexp that will
#  be used to map a variable name to its contents. Thus, the variables your
#  application provides can reside completely internally.
