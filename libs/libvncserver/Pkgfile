# Description: A library to make writing a VNC server easy.
#  LibVNCServer is a library that makes it easy to make a VNC server. All you
#  do is provide a frame buffer and some I/O functions, and call a function
#  each time the frame buffer changes. It supports all encodings known,
#  including tight, zlib, ZRLE, and cursor encodings. It also includes
#  the HTTP server from Xvnc, so you can start a java viewer by surfing
#  to http://my.vnc.server:5801 or similar. It includes a beta version of
#  LibVNCClient, which makes it easy to make a VNC client. Also included
#  is LinuxVNC, which is to the Linux console as WinVNC is to the Windows
#  desktop.
