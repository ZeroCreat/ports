# Description: The XSLT C library developed for the GNOME project.
#  Libxslt is a C library for GNOME which allows developers to work with
#  XSLT. It is based on libxml for XML parsing, tree manipulation, and XPath
#  support. Also included is 'xsltproc', a command line XSLT processor. The
#  library is written in plain C, making as few assumptions as possible,
#  and sticking closely to ANSI C/POSIX for easy embedding. It should work on
#  Linux, Unix, and Windows. Though not designed primarily with performances
#  in mind, libxslt seems to be a relatively fast processor. It also include
#  full support for the EXSLT set of extension functions as well as some
#  common extensions present in other XSLT engines.
