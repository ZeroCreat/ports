# Description: LPSM is a C library with a simple interface that manages a segment of memory backed by a persistent file
# It differs from ordinary mmap() in two ways: it can optionally offer heap
# management (malloc/free/realloc) within the arena, and more importantly,
# a transaction log is used to ensure the consistency of the persistent
# representation. The application notifies LPSM whenever the arena is in a
# consistent state, suitable for checkpointing. If the application or system
# crashes, the arena will always be recovered to a consistent checkpoint.
