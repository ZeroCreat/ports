# Package: libmimetic
# Description: A powerful, full featured, STL-based, standards compliant C++ MIME library.
# mimetic is a MIME library written in C++ designed to be easy to use and
# integrate but yet fast and efficient. It's standard compliant using the
# Standard Template Library for base C++ structures and supporting all
# relevant messaging RFCs. A powerful template encoding/decoding engine is
# also included to allow seamless extendibility (i.e. encryption codecs)
# and intuitive codec chains creation (using well-known Unix-style pipes
# syntax: a|b|c). Real world examples, documentation, and regression tests
# are included.

# URL: http://mime.codesink.org/mimetic_mime_library.html
# Maintainer: Roman Senn <rs@adfinis.com>
# Depends on: libc6, libgcc1, libstdc++6
