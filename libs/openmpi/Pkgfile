# Description: A next-generation implementation of the MPI standard.
#  Open MPI is a project that originated as the merging of technologies
#  and resources from several other projects (FT- MPI, LA-MPI, LAM/MPI, and
#  PACX-MPI) in order to build the best MPI library available. A completely
#  new MPI-2 compliant implementation, Open MPI offers advantages for
#  system and software vendors, application developers, and computer science
#  researchers. It is easy to use, and runs natively on a wide variety of
#  operating systems, network interconnects, and batch/scheduling systems.
