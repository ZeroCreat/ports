# Description: A structured file reader for the Record-JAR format.
#  Open-RJ is an library that implements readers for the Record-Jar
#  structured text file format. Mappings are provided to several languages
#  and technologies, including C++, COM, D, Java, .NET, Python, Ruby, and
#  STL. In addition to platform-independence, the library focuses on small
#  runtime costs - memory and speed - and the classic UNIX attributes of
#  discoverability and visibility.
