# Description: The Parma Polyhedra Library
#  The Parma Polyhedra Library (PPL) provides numerical abstractions
#  especially targeted at applications in the field of analysis and
#  verification of complex systems. These abstractions include convex
#  polyhedra, defined as the intersection of a finite number of (open
#  or closed) halfspaces, each described by a linear inequality (strict
#  or non-strict) with rational coefficients; some special classes of
#  polyhedra shapes that offer interesting complexity/precision tradeoffs;
#  and grids which represent regularly spaced points that satisfy a set of
#  linear congruence relations. The library also supports finite powersets
#  and products of (any kind of) polyhedra and grids and a mixed integer
#  linear programming problem solver using an exact-arithmetic version of
#  the simplex algorithm. (More details are available on the PPL's internal
#  mechanisms.)
#  The Parma Polyhedra Library is: user friendly (you write x + 2*y + 5*z <=
#  7 when you mean it); fully dynamic (available virtual memory is the only
#  limitation to the dimension of anything); portable (written in standard
#  C++, with C, Java, Objective CAML and Prolog interfaces, and following
#  all the applicable standards); exception-safe (never leaks resources or
#  leaves invalid object fragments around); efficient (and we hope to make it
#  even more so); thoroughly documented; free software (distributed under the
#  terms of the GNU General Public License version 3 or any later version).
