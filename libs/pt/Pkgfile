# Description: Extremely lightweight stackless threads in C.
# Protothreads are a type of extremely lightweight, stackless threads
# written in 100% portable C. While protothreads were originally designed
# for severely memory-constrained systems such as deeply embedded systems,
# they have found a number of uses as a general purpose portable library
# as well.
