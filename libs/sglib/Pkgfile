# Description: A simple, generic library for C.
#  Sglib is a generic library for C that was inspired by the Standard
#  Template Library from C++. It consists of a single header file
#  and no binary code. It defines useful macros for sorting arrays and
#  manipulating lists, sorted lists, double linked lists, hashed containers,
#  and red-black trees. Macros are parametrized by the type of the data
#  structure. The library does not enforce its own data representation,
#  but acts on user-defined types. It does not enforce any particular memory
#  management system.
