# Description: A C++ implementation of the signal/slot paradigm.
#  The sigslot library is a portable, type-safe, thread-safe implementation
#  of the signal/slot paradigm written entirely as a C++ template
#  library. No preprocessor is required. The library can coexist with
#  other C++ libraries, notably the Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC),
#  adding Qt-like functionality to any suitably instrumented classes. The
#  library should work fine with any reasonably standards compliant C++
#  compiler that supports the STL and templates with optional template
#  parameters. Partial template specialisation is NOT required.
