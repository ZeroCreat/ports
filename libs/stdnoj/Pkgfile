# Description: A cross-platform C++ class library.
# stdnoj is a cross-platform C++ class library that includes classes for
# using portable strings, databases, SMTP, POP, NNTP, arrays, files,
# directories, logging, email, and sockets. While templates are used,
# no reliance upon STL or other (traditionally error-prone) technologies
# has been used, which increases portability between compilers.
