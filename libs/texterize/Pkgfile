# Description: A text and metadata extraction library and tools supporting many file formats.
#  Texterize is a text and metadata extraction tool and library which can
#  be used to quickly get the text content of a file. It currently supports
#  file formats like PDF, Excel, Powerpoint, Word, RTF, WordPerfect, MP3,
#  Ogg, and all OpenDocument file formats. The output of texterize is either
#  text or XML. It is also designed to work with Unicode input and output,
#  and the default output character set is UTF-8. Texterize also has a
#  recursive mode so that whole directories (or whole filesystems) can be
#  converted to text. This recursion also works through archive files and
#  compressed files like zip, tar, and gz files.
