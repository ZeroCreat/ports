# Description: An extremely compact C++ console development library derived from Qt 3.
#  Since version 3, Qt has become more than a GUI toolkit. It now is a
#  complete programming platform that offers solutions to the most commonly
#  used back-end functionalities. TinyQ contains only these classes and
#  thus finally provides a very easy to use, fast, and stable API for C++
#  without having to depend on X11. It provides the following features in
#  an extremely compact library: UTF8 and ASCII strings, type optimized
#  collections (dictionary, map, cache, vector, list), regular expressions,
#  filesystem access, URL processing, threads, shared library handling,
#  storing and retrieving user settings, date and time handling, DOM &
#  SAX XML parsers, optimized data and text streams, and abstract IO devices.
