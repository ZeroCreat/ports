# Description: CGI search interface and indexers using Xapian
#  This package contains the "omega" CGI application which provides a
#  customisable web interface for searching Xapian databases.
#  The package also contains the "omindex" tool for indexing local documents
#  into a Xapian database in a form suitable for searching with omega.
#  This package also contains the "scriptindex" indexer, which takes a
#  simple text input format representing documents as a set of fields,
#  together with an "index script" file specifying actions to be performed
#  on each field, and processes the documents into a Xapian database.
#  The package also contains some example scripts for converting data from
#  different sources into a form suitable for processing with "scriptindex".
