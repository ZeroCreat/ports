# Description: Multithreaded C++ cross-platform application framework.
#  ZooLib allows one to write a single set of C++ sources which can
#  be compiled into native executables for Mac OS, Windows, BeOS,
#  or POSIX-compliant systems that use the X Window system (such as
#  Linux). Zoolib provides a GUI toolkit with a uniquely flexible
#  layout system. It also provides a single-file database format, TCP
#  networking, and extensive debugging support. ZooLib applications are
#  multithreaded. ZooLib requires only minimal support from the underlying
#  OS and platform GUI layer, and thus could be ported to a completely new
#  platform without too much difficulty. ZooLib is fully production quality
#  on Windows and MacOS, completely implemented but untested on BeOS, and
#  not yet complete on POSIX. Please note that the sources from the "demo"
#  branch are also required to build ZooLib or to get started writing your
#  own ZooLib applications.
