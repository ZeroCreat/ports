# Description: Automagical Kernel Configuration
#  AutoKernConf is an attempt to help user to find an optimal configuration
#  of Linux kernels. It can help you to find what configuration option
#  (and what driver) you need for your hardware.
#  Nowaday it is not easy to have such information, either because kernel
#  drivers tend to have the name of the first (and now obsolete) supported
#  device of a class, and the vendors sell cloned devices, without telling
#  the user what chips (and compatibility) are build in the pieces of
#  hardware.
#  The actual AutoKernConf is not so powerfull as the older version:
#  the earlier versions (in 2000 and 2001) were more powerfull (but with
#  newer hardware), so I'll forward-port some of the old (and non so driver
#  database driven) feature, it need some new euristics to find what people
#  want to configure, and probably should take information about previous
#  udev runs.
#  AutoKernConf is an direct application of the LKDDb: Linux Kernel Driver
#  DataBase.
