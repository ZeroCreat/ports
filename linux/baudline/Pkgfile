# Description: A time frequency browser designed for spectrum analysis data visualization.
#  Baudline is a time-frequency browser designed for scientific visualization
#  of the spectral domain. Signal analysis is performed by Fourier,
#  correlation, and raster transforms that create colorful spectrograms
#  with vibrant detail. Conduct test and measurement experiments with the
#  built in function generator, or play back audio files with a multitude of
#  effects and filters. The baudline signal analyzer combines fast digital
#  signal processing, versatile high speed displays, and continuous capture
#  tools for hunting down and studying elusive signal characteristics.
