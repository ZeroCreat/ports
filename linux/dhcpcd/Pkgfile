# Description: An RFC2131 compliant DHCP client.
#  dhcpcd is an RFC2131 compliant DHCP client. It is fully featured and yet
#  lightweight: the binary is 46k as reported by size(1) on Linux i386. It
#  has support for duplicate address detection, IPv4LL, carrier detection,
#  and a merged resolv.conf and ntp.conf for which other DHCP clients
#  require third party tools.
