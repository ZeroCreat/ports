# Description: Give realtime capabilities to an application.
#  GIVERTCAP is a small Linux application that is used to give other
#  application real-time capabilities. With the aid of givertcap you
#  can run real-time applications (audio and video -processing apps for
#  example) with high priority without running the application as root. Your
#  application does get a collection capabilities that allow it to run at
#  very high priority.
#  Givertcap was created to overcome the lack of capability support in Linux
#  file systems. Once the Linux file systems start to have the necessary
#  functions themselves, this apps becomes unnecessary.
#  To use this app you need to compile it and make it setuid-root. After
#  this other applications can use this mini-app to gain capabilities that
#  are necessary for real-time operation.
