# Description: Boot loader for Linux/x86 and other PC operating systems
# It is responsible for loading your Linux kernel from either a floppy
# or a hard drive and passing control to it. It is capable of booting
# beyond cylinder 1024 of a hard disk if the BIOS supports EDD packet call
# extensions to the int 0x13 interface. LILO can also be used to boot
# many other operating systems, including DOS, Windows (all versions),
# OS/2, and the BSD variants. The LILO distribution includes full source,
# documentation and support files.
