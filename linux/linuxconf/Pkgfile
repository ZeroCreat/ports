# Description: A sophisticated administrative tool.
#  Linuxconf is a sophisticated administrative tool. It is both an activator
#  and a configurator, and can manage quite a few system tasks. It has some
#  unique features, like configuration versioning and multiple machine
#  management. It supports multiples languages (French, German, Italian,
#  etc.) and can be administered from ncurses (text), Web, command line,
#  or X (GNOME or wxxt) user interfaces.
