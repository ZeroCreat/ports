          USB: hi and low bdc are now 4 digit hex-numbers (instead of
          decimal numbers)

File format

   driver-db file is an text file. Lines starting with # are comments.

   The fields are space separated. In the description of fields we use the
   following (printf-like) convention:

   %nx
          an hexadecimal mask with n digits. The digit are always written
          lowercase. A . means any single digit.

   %s
          a string. Eventually the double quotes and the backslashes are
          quoted with an additional backslash

   %C
          a space separated list of kernel configuration items (CONFIG_).
          Every token start with CONFIG_

   %F
          a kernel filename. Paths are relative to the top kernel source
          directory

   A standard line if formed by:

   drv sub-sytem %nx... %s... %C # %F

   where the configuration list (%C) is the kernel configuration symbols
   that need to be set (m or y) to activate kernel driver relative to the
   probed hardware. The special CONFIG__UNKNOW__ symbol is used both for
   yet unknow symbol (error or unimplemented feature on the scanner), or
   for the drivers that are always included in the kernel. The kernel
   filename (%F) is the file that contain the hardware definition.

Hardware data

   In this section we enumerate the probes of numbers and strings provided
   directly by hardware. Usually these detection are done on bus level and
   should be complete.

pci

   PCI bus devices. Format:

   pci '%4x %4x %4x %4x %4x' %C # %F

   where the fields are (left to right):

     * vendor
     * device
     * subvendor
     * subdevice
     * class-mask
     * configuration list
     * filename of the driver

   Note: The pci.ids file from lspci package or from kernel translates the
   codes into real names. An online version is in The Linux PCI ID
   Repository

usb

   USB bus devices. Format

   drv 'usb %4x %4x %2x%2x%2x %2x%2x%2x ....' %4x %4x %C # %F

   where the fields are (left to right):

     * idVendor
     * idProduct

     * bInterfaceSubClass
     * bInterfaceProtocol
     * bcdDevice_lo
     * bcdDevice_hi
     * configuration list
     * filename of the driver

   The dots are used by detection for the bcdDevice fields, but in
   database there is only the low and the hi limit of such number.

   Note: A list of USB ID with full name is available as usb.ids file
   (which is part of usbutils)
