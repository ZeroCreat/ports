# Description: An n-dimensional raytracer.
#  rt is an n-dimensional raytracer. It supports any positive number of
#  spatial dimensions, color and grayscale, cylinders with an arbitrary
#  number of round dimensions (spheres and cubes are special cases of
#  cylinders), quadratic surfaces, convex hulls, regular polytopes, unions,
#  intersections, cuts, extrusions, reflection, refraction, functional
#  texture maps, portals into other traces, ambient light, multiple light
#  sources, directional light sources, gamma correction, fish-eye effect,
#  and output as PNG or PPM. It has been tested under DOS, Solaris, Digital
#  Unix, FreeBSD, NetBSD, Linux, Ultrix, System V, and BeOS.
