# Description: Authentication program that uses CRAM-MD5 authentiaction mode.
#  cmd5checkpw is a checkpassword compatible authentication program that
#  uses CRAM-MD5 authentiaction mode. It was designed primary to work
#  with qmail but it can be used by any other program that knows how
#  to use checkpassword compatible authentication. Actualy you can save
#  yourself a lot of work using this program instead of patching other
#  programs. Changing a program to use checkpassword is certainly simplier
#  than adding whole CRAM-MD5 support. This code is based on the original
#  checkpassword by Dan Bernstein. It uses MD5 and HMAC algorithms as
#  described in rfc1321 and rfc2104
#  .
