# Description: A utility for dynamic IP address antispam filtering.
#  DynaStop is a utility to examine IPv4 based addresses for Exim and
#  procmail for the purpose of filtering based upon patterns defined by
#  the administrator. This can be a pivotal factor in email filtering and
#  server load management, since dynamic IP addresses are typically used
#  for dial-up, DHCP, and DSL accounts. All of which have a designated mail
#  exchange server through which all outbound mail flows as defined with
#  many, if not most, large Internet service providers.
