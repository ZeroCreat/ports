# Description: A fetchmail replacement with qmail-like Maildir and external MDA delivery.
#  getmail is intended as a simple, secure, and reliable replacement for
#  fetchmail. It retrieves email (either all messages, or only unread
#  messages) from one or more POP3, SPDS, or IMAP4 servers (with or
#  without SSL) for one or more email accounts, and reliably delivers into
#  qmail-style Maildirs, mboxrd files, or through external MDAs (command
#  deliveries) specified on a per-account basis. getmail also has excellent
#  support for domain (multidrop) mailboxes, including delivering messages to
#  different users or destinations based on the envelope recipient address.
