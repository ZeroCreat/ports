# Description: An IMAP mailbox synchronization tool.
#  imapsync is a tool for facilitating incremental recursive IMAP transfers
#  from one mailbox to another. It is useful for mailbox migration, and
#  reduces the amount of data transferred by only copying messages that
#  are not present on both servers. Read, unread, and deleted flags are
#  preserved, and the process can be stopped and resumed. The original
#  messages can optionally be deleted after a successful transfer.
