# Description: A spam and virus check proxy for email servers.
# Imabluri takes a message from your SMTP server, runs virus and spam
# checks on it, and does some marking and logging. Afterwards, it hands
# the message over to your mailbox system or IMAP/POP3 server. A daemon
# approach minimizes the system load. A very small client program actually
# takes the mail from the SMTP server, writes it to your hard drive, and
# adds it to a MySQL database. The daemon is polled after the client stores
# the message, and tries to spawn a child process that does the actual
# checks. This project replaces vislog, which will no longer be mantained.
