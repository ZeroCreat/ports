# Description: An alternative to procmail for sorting and processing mail in maildirs.
#  maildirproc is a program that processes one or several existing mail
#  boxes in the maildir format. It is primarily focused on mail sorting,
#  which means moving, copying, forwarding, and deleting mail according to
#  a set of rules. It can be seen as an alternative to procmail, but instead
#  of being a delivery agent (which wants to be part of the delivery chain),
#  maildirproc only processes mail which has already been delivered. That
#  is a feature, not a bug.
