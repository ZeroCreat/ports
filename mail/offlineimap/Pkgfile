# Description: A tool to bi-directionally synchronize IMAP/Maildir email boxes.
#  OfflineIMAP is a tool to simplify email reading. It allows you to read
#  the same mailbox from multiple computers and ensures that your changes
#  will be automatically reflected on all computers. You can use various
#  mail clients to read a single box or read mail while offline with full
#  synchronization when you reconnect. You can read IMAP mail with readers
#  that lack IMAP support (same goes for SSL). OfflineIMAP's multithreaded
#  synchronization algorithm performs between 10 and 60 times faster than
#  many mail readers' internal IMAP support, and it can be used even with
#  mail readers that support IMAP already. There are five available user
#  interface modules, including scripted execution, an interactive terminal
#  interface, and GUI interfaces.
