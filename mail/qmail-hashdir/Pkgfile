# Description: Hashed user directories for qmail
#  This package extends qmail's functionality by adding a system to manage
#  users directories (and the Maildirs there) in a scalable manner. In
#  particular, it allows for hundreds of thousands or even millions of users
#  on a system, across multiple domains, and implemented on multiple machines
#  sharing storage for mailboxes. The package provides a set of tools
#  enabling you to hash users' [mail] directories, avoiding the problems
#  associated with placing them all in the same directory (esp. manageability
#  for the sysadmin, and in certain cases filesystem limitations). The
#  core of the package is a modification (patch) to qmail-local for how
#  it searches for a user's 'Home' directory. qmail-hashdir uses the
#  fairly ubiquitous P. J. Weinberger hash function, and avoids using
#  system libraries where possible, using instead library functions from a
#  neighbouring qmail installation (i.e. this software relies on the same
#  functions written by Dan Bernstein that qmail itself does). Note that
#  there are
#  .
#  security issues with this package. That doesn't mean the package is
#  broken, but that it makes certain assumptions that you should understand
#  fully before using qmail-hashdir - see the text file SECURITY provided
#  as part of the distribution.
