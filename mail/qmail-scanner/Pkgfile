# Description: Qmail Perl email scanner
# Qmail-Scanner, (also known as scan4virus) is an addon that enables a Qmail
# Email server to scan all gatewayed Email for certain characteristics. It
# is typically used for its anti-virus protection functions, in which case
# it is used in conjunction with commercial virus scanners. but also enables
# a site to react to Email (at a server/site level) that contains specific
# strings in particular headers, or particular attachment filenames or
# types (e.g. *.VBS attachments). It also can be used as an archiving tool
# for auditing or backup purposes. Qmail-Scanner is integrated into the
# mail server at a lower level than some other Unix-based virus scanners,
# resulting in better performance. It is capable of scanning not only
# locally sent/received Email, but also Email that crosses the server in
# a relay capacity. It also has SpamAssassin support.
