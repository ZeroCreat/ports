# Description: A framework for socket map processors for Sendmail.
# Sendmail SocketMap Daemon Framework provides tools for handling socket
# map processors. It includes a threaded TCP server, the netstring
# codec, map name dispatching, configuration file processing, and more,
# so that someone who wishes to design and implement a particular socket
# map can focus completely on the particular task the socket map has to
# perform. The particular socket map processor appears as a shared object
# which is dynamically loaded by the daemon depending on the configuration.
