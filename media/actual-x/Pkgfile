# Description: Allows broadcasters to use available sound-bits in their broadcasts.
#  Actual-X is an online audio actuality search program that allows
#  broadcasters to load, search by subject, audibly preview and if satisfied
#  with a selection, copy a news actuality into an online networked
#  digital system. Actual-X allows broadcaster to easily incorporate
#  available digital audio sound-bits into the next broadcast. Actual-X
#  tries to take a realistic view of the news workflow and the use of news
#  actualities. Actual-X was developed under these workflow guidelines to
#  make the use of audio cuts user friendly. Audio cuts on Actual-X average
#  40-seconds in length though the program is not length restrictive, nor
#  is it restrictive with regard to the number of cuts that can be archived
#  in the system.
