# Description: An API for accessing a variety of audio file formats.
#  The Audio File Library provides a uniform and elegant API for accessing
#  a variety of audio file formats, such as AIFF/AIFF-C, WAVE, NeXT/Sun
#  .snd/.au, Berkeley/IRCAM/CARL Sound File, Audio Visual Research, Amiga
#  IFF/8SVX, and NIST SPHERE. Supported compression formats are currently
#  G.711 mu-law and A-law and IMA and MS ADPCM.
#  Key goals of the Audio File Library are file format transparency and
#  data format transparency. The same calls for opening a file, accessing
#  and manipulating audio metadata (e.g. sample rate, sample format, textual
#  information, MIDI parameters), and reading/writing sample data will work
#  with any supported audio file format. Likewise, the format of the audio
#  data presented to the application need not be tied to the format of the
#  data contained in the file.
#  The Audio File Library distributed under the GNU Library General Public
#  License.
