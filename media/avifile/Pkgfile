# Description: Compressed AVI file support library for x86 Linux.
#  Avifile is a library that allows you to read and write compressed AVI
#  files in most common video & audio formats (Indeo&reg; Video, DivX,
#  etc.) under x86 Linux. Compression and decompression are performed with
#  Win32 DLLs. It includes a simple AVI player and a Video4Linux capture
#  program. Currently it is under heavy development, and while some features
#  (such as AVI playback) already work, some (audio compression) are not
#  yet successfully implemented.
