# Description: Very fast and versatile 3D modeller/renderer
#  Blender is an integrated 3d suite for modelling, animation, rendering,
#  post-production, interactive creation and playback (games). Blender
#  has its own particular user interface, which is implemented entirely in
#  OpenGL and designed with speed in mind. Python bindings are available for
#  scripting; import/export features for popular file formats like 3D Studio
#  and Wavefront Obj are implemented as scripts by the community. Stills,
#  animations, models for games or other third party engines and interactive
#  content in the form of a standalone binary and/or a web plug-in are common
#  products of Blender use. Very fast and versatile 3D modeller/renderer
