# Description: A CD ripping application.
#  cdparanoia reads audio from the CDROM directly as data, with no analog
#  step between, and writes the data to a file or pipe in WAV, AIFC or raw
#  16 bit linear PCM. Cdparanoia will read correct, rock-solid audio data
#  from inexpensive drives prone to misalignment, frame jitter and loss of
#  streaming during atomic reads. cdparanoia will also read and repair data
#  from CDs that have been damaged in some way.
