# Description: Disk-At-Once Recording of Audio CD-Rs
#  Cdrdao records audio/data CD-Rs in disk-at-once (DAO) mode based on
#  a textual description of the CD contents (toc-file). Features include
#  full control over length and contents of pre-gaps (pause areas between
#  tracks). Pre-gaps may be completely omitted, e.g. for dividing live
#  recordings into tracks. Control over sub-channel data like catalog
#  numbers, copy, pre-emphasis, 2-/4-channel flags, ISRC code, and index
#  marks are provided as well. GCDMaster is a Gnome GUI front-end that lets
#  you import MP3 and WAV files, select track markers and cut/copy/paste
#  audio snippets before burning.
