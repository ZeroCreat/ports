# Description: An optical character recognition system that can recognize handwritten text.
#  Classnotes is an OCR (optical character recognition) system capable of
#  translating scans of handwriting (or of custom fonts) into text. In
#  order to translate scans, the program must be trained with samples
#  of the text the user intends to translate. The Classnotes translation
#  algorithm is based on naive Bayesian statistics similar to those employed
#  in text-based email filters. The program features a full GUI for both
#  training and parsing new scans.
