# Description: A learning MP3 player.
#  Cymbaline is a learning music player. It sets a score for each track
#  based on your listening habits, and you can set thresholds to create
#  playlists with your favorite tracks automatically. In random mode, it
#  will play your favorite tracks more often. It also allows album-based
#  navigation: you can start playing the next album, skip 2 albums ahead,
#  go to a specific album, etc. It has a random queue mode where you see
#  a list of randomly chosen tracks that play consecutively. The queue is
#  also built based on song scores.
