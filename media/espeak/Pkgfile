# Description: A compact multilingual text to speech synthesis engine.
#  eSpeak is a compact text to speech engine for good quality English and
#  other languages. Its clear articulation and good intonation makes it
#  suitable for listening to long text articles. It can speak text files
#  from the command line, and also operates as a "talker" within the KDE
#  TTS system and with a Gnome Speech driver, as an alternative to Festival
#  or other similar programs. Windows SAPI5 and command line versions are
#  also available.
