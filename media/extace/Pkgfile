# Description: An ESD FFT realtime audio visualizer.
#  eXtace is a visual sound display/analysis program. It requires Esound
#  (esd) for its audio source. It includes various fast fourier transforms
#  of the audio data in realtime. Its displays include a 3D wireframe flying
#  landscape, a 3D textured flying landscape, a 16-256 channel graphic EQ,
#  three types of scopes, a 3D "spike" flying landscape, and two forms of
#  spectragrams. The 3D traces can be picked up, manipulated, and displayed
#  at nearly any angle. eXtace also features a 3D direction control widget
#  for controlling the angle and speed at which the trace runs away and a
#  gradient/colormap editor for changing the colormap to suit your needs. No
#  OpenGL is required.
