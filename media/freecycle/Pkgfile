# Description: A beat slicer.
#  Freecycle is a beat slicer providing amplitude domain and frequency
#  domain beat matching and zero crossing algorithms. It exports sliced
#  audio chunks and generates a MIDI file which can be used to play the
#  sliced loop. Alternatively, you can jam with it as soon as you've made
#  slices using a MIDI keyboard or sequencer. Freecycle also exports AKAI
#  S5000/S6000/Z4/Z8 .AKP files to be used with your favorite sampler,
#  SoundFont files, and supports slice drag and drop from the application
#  to the desktop. It can process the audio inline using LADSPA effects,
#  as well as applying envelopes to seperate slices.
