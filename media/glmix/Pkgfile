# Description: GL Mixer offers a 3D visualisation of stereo mixing
#  GL Mixer offers a 3D visualisation of stereo mixing. The spatial interface
#  isn't very space compact, but it looks cool and can sometimes be a
#  more intuitive way to mix audio. Because GL Mixer is a JACK client it
#  allows you to do all your mixing in one place, prior to final processor
#  effects and output, rather than using separate pan & level controls in
#  other applications.
#  Future versions of GL Mixer will probably include things like MIDI
#  integration and automation, which should make it more generally
#  useful. More eye candy will be introduced at the discretion of the author.
#  People who saw the Be Operating System demonstrated in the 1990s may find
#  GL Mixer very familiar. Of course GL Mixer shares no code with that demo
#  and hopefully as a JACK app it's rather more useful.
