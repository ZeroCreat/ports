# Description: Listens to a GPS and provides clients with the data.
#  gpsd is a daemon that listens to a GPS or Loran receiver and translates
#  the positional data into a simplified format that can be more easily used
#  by other programs, like chart plotters. The package comes with a sample
#  client that plots the location of the currently visible GPS satellites
#  (if available) and a speedometer. It can also use DGPS/ip.
