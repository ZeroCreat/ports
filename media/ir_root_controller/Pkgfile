# Description: A daemon for handling LIRC events.
#  ir-root-controller is a small daemon which listens to the LIRC (Linux
#  Infrared Remote Control) daemon and executes system events. It is intended
#  to be run as a system daemon and does not require any user to have set
#  up LIRC or events for LIRC. An example application would be changing
#  the global system volume irrespective of what applications are running
#  or which users (if any) are logged in.
