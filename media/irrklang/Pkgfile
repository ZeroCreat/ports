# Description: irrKlang is a cross platform audio library designed to be used
# in games, scientific simulations and similar.
# It is a high level 2D and 3D cross platform (Windows, Mac OS X, Linux) sound
# engine and audio library which plays WAV, MP3, OGG, MOD, XM, IT, S3M and
# more file formats, and is usable in C++ and all .NET languages (C#, VisualBasic.NET, etc). It has all the features known from low level audio libraries as well as lots of useful features like a sophisticated streaming engine, extendable audio reading, single and multithreading modes, 3d audio emulation for low end hardware, a plugin system, multiple rolloff models and more. All this can be accessed via an extremely simple API.
