# Description: A JACK audio sequencer.
#  Jackbeat is an audio sequencer with support for the JACK Audio Connection
#  Kit. Featuring a drum-machine-like interface, it is designed with
#  real-time operation in mind: while playing, the pattern can be edited,
#  the BPM rate modified, and new samples loaded. The number of tracks
#  and beats is virtually unlimited, and though it is simple, it becomes
#  a powerful tool when connected to other JACK applications providing
#  mastering, effects plugins, etc.
