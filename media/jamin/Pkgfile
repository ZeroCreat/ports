# Description: A JACK Audio Mastering interface.
#  JAMin is a realtime mastering processor designed to bring out the detail
#  in recorded music and provide the final layer of polish. Every effort has
#  been made to ensure a clean, distortion-free signal path. All processing
#  elements use linear-phase filtering, ensuring that no phase distortion
#  is introduced. JAMin uses the JACK Audio Connection Kit, a low-latency
#  audio server, which can connect a number of different applications to
#  an audio device, and also allow them to share audio among themselves.
