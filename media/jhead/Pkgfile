# Description: A command line driven Exif header parser and manipulator.
#  Jhead is a command line driven utility for extracting digital camera
#  settings from the Exif format files used by many digital cameras. It
#  handles the various confusing ways these can be expressed, and displays
#  them as F-stop, shutter speed, etc. It is also able to reduce the size
#  of digital camera JPEGs without loss of information, by deleting integral
#  thumbnails that digital cameras put into the Exif header. If you need to
#  add Exif support to a program, this is a simple program to cut and paste
#  from. Many projects, including PHP, have reused code from this utility.
