# Description: A library for finding visually similar bitmap pictures.
#  The Puzzle library is designed to quickly find visually similar
#  images (GIF, PNG, JPG), even if they have been resized, recompressed,
#  recolored, or slightly modified. The library is lightweight yet very
#  fast, configurable, and easy to use, and was designed with security in
#  mind. This is a C library, but it also comes with a command-line tool
#  and PHP bindings.
