# Description: A very powerful audio stream generator for Internet radio stations.
#  Liquidsoap is a powerful tool for building complex audio streaming
#  systems, typically targetting Internet radio stations. It consists
#  of a simple script language, which has a first-class notion of source
#  (basically a stream) and provides elementary source constructors and
#  source compositions from which you can build the streamer you want. There
#  is no constraint on the streams, in contrast to many other tools which
#  can only stream one file after another. Moreover, it is not restricted
#  to a single stream. Finally, it interfaces well with external tools.
