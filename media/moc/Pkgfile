# Description: A console audio player (MP3, OGG, FLAC, WMA, other) with ncurses interface.
#  MOC (music on console) is a console audio player with a simple ncurses
#  interface in playmp3list style. It supports MP3 (with ID3 tag, VBR,
#  and Xing headers), Ogg, FLAC, WAVE, Musepack, Speex, WMA, MP4, AAC, and
#  some other less popular audio formats. Playlists can be saved and loaded
#  using .m3u files (PLS version 2 can also be loaded). Internet streams
#  (Shoutcast, Icecast) are supported. It achieves gapless playback by
#  employing an output buffer in a separate thread and file pre-caching. The
#  key mapping can be fully customized. The interface can be detached from
#  the server as it plays in the background.
