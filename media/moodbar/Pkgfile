# Description: Analysis program for creating a colorful visual representation of an audio file
#  The Moodbar is an algorithm for creating a colorful visual representation
#  of the contents of an audio file, giving an idea of its "mood" (this is
#  a rather fanciful term for the simple analysis it actually does). The
#  Moodbar was invented by Gavin Wood and Simon O'Keefe for inclusion in
#  the Amarok music player.
#  This package contains a GStreamer plugin with elements that are used in
#  the moodbar analysis, and an application that actually does the analysis.
