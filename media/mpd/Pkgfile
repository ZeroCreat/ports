# Description: A jukebox server that controls music playback.
#  Music Player Daemon (MPD) is a server that allows remote access for
#  playing music in various formats and managing playlists. It makes a great
#  desktop player with frontend options (Qt, GTK, ncurses, Windows, and Web
#  clients are available). It is also appropriate as a console player that is
#  scriptable, and is especially useful if X is restarted frequently. A set
#  of rapid development tools for clients are being developed and include a C
#  library, Python module, PHP class, Perl module, and Java Class. The goals
#  are to be easy to install and use, to have minimal resource requirements,
#  to be stable and flexible, and easy to interface.
