# Description: A fully free clone of mpg123, a command-line mp3 player.
#  mpg321 is a Free clone of mpg123, a command-line MP3 player. It is
#  designed to be a drop-in replacement for mpg123, and therefore its
#  interface has been designed around that of mpg123, without using any
#  of its code. mpg321 has been designed for use with frontends such as
#  gqmpeg, although it is just as useful on the command-line. Unlike mpg123,
#  it supports ESD and ALSA output without recompiling, and it does all
#  MP3 decoding with only fixed-point math by using the mad MPEG audio
#  decoder library.

# Maintainer: Roman Senn <rs@adfinis.com>
# Depends on: mpg321
