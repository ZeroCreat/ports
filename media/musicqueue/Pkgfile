# Description: A CGI music jukebox using external tools to play the files.
#  Musicqueue is a CGI music jukebox using external tools to play the
#  files. Because of that it supports several formats. It supports two modes,
#  enqueue and vote. In vote mode users can vote on music and the song with
#  the most votes is played. In enqueue mode, songs are enqueued and the
#  one that's been in the playlist the longest is played. It is themable
#  through CSS and has many configuration options.
