# Description: A CFD toolbox.
#  The OpenFOAM (Open Field Operation and Manipulation) CFD toolbox can
#  simulate anything from complex fluid flows involving chemical reactions,
#  turbulence, and heat transfer, to solid dynamics, electromagnetics, and
#  the pricing of financial options. It uses finite volume numerics to solve
#  systems of partial differential equations ascribed on any 3D unstructured
#  mesh of polyhedral cells. The fluid flow solvers are developed within
#  a robust, implicit, pressure-velocity, iterative solution framework,
#  although alternative techniques are applied to other continuum mechanics
#  solvers.
