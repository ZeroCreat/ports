# Description: A perceptual hash library.
#  pHash is an implementation of various perceptual hashing algorithms. A
#  perceptual hash is a fingerprint of an audio, video, or image file
#  that is mathematically based on the audio or visual content contained
#  within. Unlike cryptographic hash functions that rely on the avalanche
#  effect of small changes in input leading to drastic changes in the output,
#  perceptual hashes are "close" to one another if the inputs are visually
#  or auditorily similar. As a result, perceptual hashes must also be robust
#  enough to take into account transformations that could have been performed
#  on the input.
