# Description: An optimizer for PNG files that can also insert or delete specified chunks.
#  pngcrush is an excellent batch-mode compression utility for PNG
#  images. Depending on the application that created the original PNGs,
#  it can improve the file size anywhere from a few percent to 40% or more
#  (completely losslessly). The utility also allows specified PNG chunks
#  (e.g. text comments) to be inserted or deleted, and it can fix incorrect
#  gamma info written by Photoshop 5.0 as well as the erroneous iCCP chunk
#  written by Photoshop 5.5.
