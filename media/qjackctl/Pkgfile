# Description: A simple Qt application to control the JACK sound server daemon.
#  QjackCtl is a simple Qt application to control the JACK sound server
#  daemon, specifically for the Linux Audio Desktop infrastructure. It is
#  written in C++ around the Qt4 toolkit for X11, most exclusively using
#  Qt Designer. It provides a simple GUI dialog for setting several JACK
#  daemon parameters, which are properly saved between sessions, and a
#  way to control of the status of the audio server daemon. With time,
#  this primordial interface has become richer by including an enhanced
#  patchbay and connection control features.
