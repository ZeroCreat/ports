# Description: A software oscilloscope for sound cards and serial multimeters.
#  QOscC is a highly flexible and configurable software Oscilloscope. It
#  supports capturing data from audio devices via ALSA, OSS, or JACK,
#  and serial digital multimeters. Each scope display can be configured
#  individually to different display types (Y-T, X-Y, and FFT). The
#  captured data can be stored to data files. This software is intended for
#  electronic hobbyists who cannot afford a hardware oscilloscope or need
#  a simple spectrum analyzer, as well as for musicians for doing basic
#  signal analysis.
