# Description: A computer vision framework for tangible user interfaces.
#  reacTIVision is an open source, cross-platform computer vision framework
#  for the fast and robust tracking of fiducial markers attached to
#  physical objects, as well as for multi-touch finger tracking. It was
#  mainly designed as a toolkit for the rapid development of table-based
#  tangible user interfaces and multi-touch interactive surfaces. Client
#  application examples are available for various programming environments
#  such as C++, Java, C#, Processing, PureData and Max/MSP.
