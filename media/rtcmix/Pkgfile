# Description: Open-Source, Digital Signal Processing and Sound Synthesis Language
#  RTcmix is a real-time software "language" for doing digital sound
#  synthesis and signal-processing. It is written in C/C++, and is
#  distributed open-source, free of charge. In certain respects, it is
#  similar in function to other extant unit-generator-based software
#  languages such as CSOUND, SuperCollider and (to a lesser extent) JSyn
#  and Max/MSP -- they do share a common heritage, after all. There are
#  some differences, however, between all these languages... and variety
#  is of course the spice of life
