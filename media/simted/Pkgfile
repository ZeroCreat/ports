# Description: Simulation of complex electrical, mechanical, thermodynamical and mixed-typed systems. 
#  Simted is a fast growing C++ library which provides many features
#  for simulation of complex electrical, mechanical, thermodynamical,
#  and mixed-typed systems. There are three analysis modes implemented at
#  the moment: time domain (time response), frequency domain (frequency
#  response), and steady-state analysis.
