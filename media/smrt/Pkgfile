# Description: GUI and command-line tools for renaming and tagging MP3 and Ogg files.
#  smrt is a powerful python-based GUI and command line tool designed
#  to ease the process of constantly renaming and tagging MP3 and OGG
#  files. It performs the functions of a standard mass-tagger, such as
#  translating a filename into tags, and creating a new filename from tag
#  data. It is unique in its inclusion of powerful regular expression and
#  custom text manipulation tools to manipulate filenames and tag data,
#  and in its ability to search for and apply track data from the FreeDB
#  project. All this is presented in a streamlined, informative GTK GUI. A
#  small CLI tool is also provided for quick jobs.
