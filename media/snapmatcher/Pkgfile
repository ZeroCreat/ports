# Description: SnapMatcher is an application intended for photographers, artists, or image packrats who have very large collections of digital images, some of which may be duplicates or near duplicates. By identifying images across multiple formats with the ability to filter out minor edits such as changes to contrast, brightness, color balance, resizing, or even the addition of text or borders SnapMatcher can be a valuable tool in organizing culling unwieldy collections.
