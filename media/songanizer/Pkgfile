# Description: A script to organize a directory containing Ogg and MP3 files.
#  songanizer is a script to organize a directory containing Ogg and MP3
#  files. The script accepts a list of directories in which the real Ogg
#  and MP3 files reside. It then reads information like author, album, and
#  genre from the files' ID3 tags and creates parallel directory structures
#  which just contain symbolic links to the directories in which the real
#  files live. The goal is to create virtual directory structures which
#  give different views of the data without having redundant copies of the
#  files themselves.
