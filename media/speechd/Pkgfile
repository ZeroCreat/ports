# Description: Implements /dev/speech device (all plaintext written to it will be spoken aloud)
#  speechd implements a /dev/speech device using either the Festival or
#  rsynth speech synthesis packages. All plaintext written to this device
#  will be spoken aloud (or optionally output as morse code if you are
#  using the "morse" program as the underlying driver). Certain programs
#  have been modified to make use of this device, including an ircII script
#  called speech.irc, a Slashdot ticker called slashes and a package for
#  TiK. All of these modified packages are available on the homepage.
