# Description: A Physical Modelling Sound Synthesis Program
#  Tao is a software package for sound synthesis using physical models. It
#  provides a virtual acoustic material constructed from masses and springs
#  which can be used as the basis for building quite complex virtual musical
#  instruments. Tao comes with a synthesis language for creating and playing
#  instruments and a fully documented (eventually) C++ API for those who
#  would like to use it as an object library. The main features are:
#    * Ability to create complex virtual instruments from primitive acoustic
#      building blocks.
#    * OpenGL animated visualisations showing the acoustic waves propagating
#      through the instruments.
#    * WAV format output files.
#    * Comprehensive documentation including a user manual, tutorials
#      (eventually) and various examples. All documentation is available in
#      either LaTeX (dvi, ps) or HTML formats.
#    * Available under GNU general public license.
