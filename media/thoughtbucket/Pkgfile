# Description: A Web interface for storing random thoughts and ideas.
#  Thought Bucket is a Web application that allows user(s) to store their
#  thoughts, ideas, dreams, and hopes into a database. It is not a blogger
#  (although it could be used as one), but instead is a way to manage the
#  random thoughts that we all have from time-to-time. Thoughts are stored
#  according to user-defined categories and can be filtered by category
#  and/or age of the thoughts. Thoughts can also be marked as private,
#  so that the public cannot view them. Thought Bucket also supports
#  fully-customizable themes so that the perfect look and feel is available
#  to the owner of the bucket.
