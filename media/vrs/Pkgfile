# Description: A cross-platform C++ 3D graphics library.
#  The Virtual Rendering System is a computer graphics software library for
#  constructing interactive 3D applications. It provides a large collection
#  of 3D rendering components which facilitate implementing 3D graphics
#  applications and experimenting with 3D graphics and imaging algorithms. It
#  is implemented as a C++ library. Applications can incorporate VRS as C++
#  library based on the C++ API. In addition, it provides a complete Tcl/Tk
#  binding of the C++ API, called iVRS.
