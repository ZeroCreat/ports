# Description: Software system for 3D computer graphics, image processing, and visualization.
#  The Visualization ToolKit (VTK) is an object oriented software system for
#  3D computer graphics, image processing, and visualization. VTK includes
#  a textbook, a C++ class library, and several interpreted interface
#  layers including Tcl/Tk, Java, and Python. VTK supports a wide variety
#  of visualization algorithms including scalar, vector, tensor, texture,
#  and volumetric methods. It also supports advanced modeling techniques
#  like implicit modeling, polygon reduction, mesh smoothing, cutting,
#  contouring, and Delaunay triangulation. Moreover, dozens of imaging
#  algorithms have been integrated into the system. This allows mixing 2D
#  imaging / 3D graphics algorithms and data.
