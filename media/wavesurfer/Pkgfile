# Description: A really cool tool for sound visualization and manipulation.
#  WaveSurfer is a sound visualization/manipulation tool for novice and
#  advanced users, with a simple and intuitive user interface. It can be
#  adapted to different tasks, such as speech research and education,
#  speech/sound analysis, and sound annotation/transcription. You can
#  also make more advanced/specialized applications by extending it with
#  custom plugins or embed WaveSurfer components in other applications. Its
#  flexible interface handles many different file formats, and it runs on
#  many flavors of Windows and Unix. It also supports encoding and Unicode
#  with unlimited file size, and more.
