# Description: the xine video player, user interface
#  This is an X11 based GUI for the libxine video player library. It
#  provides xine, a skin based media player that can play all the
#  audio/video formats that libxine supports. Currently, this includes
#  MPEG1/2, some AVI and Quicktime files, some network streaming methods
#  and disc based media (VCD, SVCD, DVD). A more complete list can be found
#  on http://xinehq.de/index.php/features/.
#  Most DVDs on the market today are play-protected by the Content
#  Scrambling System (CSS). Xine does not provide any code to
#  descramble those DVDs, because of legal uncertainties. Have a look at
#  /usr/share/doc/xine-ui/README.Debian for more information!
