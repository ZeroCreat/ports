# Description:  Melys is a MIDI sequencer application for ALSA
# It records, plays back, and saves to a MIDI file or to an XML-based
# format. There is a track view where you can arrange parts using
# drag-and-drop and a piano-roll view where the same can be done with
# notes. There is also a graphical tempo view where the tempo of the
# song can be changed. Multiple files can be open at once, and notes can
# be dragged between them. It is written in C and uses the GNOME/Gtk+
# widget sets.
