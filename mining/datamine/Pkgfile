# Description: The Data Mine is a search engine designed to give users an unusually powerful interface. It is designed around human-computer intelligent interaction (making the computer a tool so humans can use their intelligence). It divides the screen into two halves: one lets you find all the instances of your query's keywords, and the other lets you look through a highlighted version of the results you choose.
