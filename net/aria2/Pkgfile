# Description: A high speed download utility.
#  aria2 is a utility for downloading files. The supported protocols are
#  HTTP(S), FTP, BitTorrent, and Metalink. It has a powerful segmented
#  downloading ability, downloading a file from multiple sources and multiple
#  protocols and utilizing your download bandwidth to the maximum. It
#  supports downloading a file from HTTP(S)/FTP and BitTorrent at the same
#  time, while the data downloaded from HTTP(S)/FTP is uploaded to the
#  BitTorrent swarm. Using Metalink's chunk checksums, aria2 automatically
#  validates chunks of data while downloading a file like BitTorrent.
