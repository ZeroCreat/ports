# Description: A distributed multicast monitoring tool.
#  Dbeacon is a distributed multicast monitoring tool. The main purpose of a
#  beacon is to monitor other beacons' reachability and to collect statistics
#  such as loss, delay, and jitter between beacons. Dbeacon supports both
#  IPv4 and IPv6 multicast and supports collecting information using both
#  Any Source Multicast (ASM) and Source-Specific Multicast (SSM).
