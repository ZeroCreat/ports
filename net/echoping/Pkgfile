# Description: A tool to test the performance of a remote host with TCP.
#  echoping is a small program to approximatively test the performance of
#  a remote host by sending it TCP "echo" packets. It is able to use the
#  following protocols: echo, discard, chargen, HTTP (with SSL if you wish),
#  ICP, and SMTP. It uses UDP instead of TCP for the protocols which accept
#  it (like echo), it can repeat the test and display various statistics,
#  and it can use T/TCP on systems which support it.
