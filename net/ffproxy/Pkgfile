# Description: A secure HTTP/HTTPS filtering proxy.
#  ffproxy is a filtering HTTP/HTTPS proxy server. It is able to filter
#  by host, URL, and header. Custom header entries can be filtered and
#  added. It can even drop its privileges and optionally chroot() to some
#  directory. Logging to syslog() is supported, as is using another auxiliary
#  proxy server. An HTTP accelerator feature (acting as a front-end to an
#  HTTP server) is included. Contacting IPv6 servers as well as binding
#  to IPv6 is supported and allows transparent IPv6 over IPv4 browsing
#  (and vice versa).
