# Description: A streaming media broadcasting system.
#  Icecast is a streaming media server which currently supports Ogg Vorbis
#  and MP3 audio streams. It can be used to create an Internet radio
#  station or a privately running jukebox and many things in between. It
#  is very versatile in that new formats can be added relatively easily,
#  and it supports open standards for communication and interaction.
