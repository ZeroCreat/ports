# Description: A time server for synchronizing networked machines' clocks.
#  intimed is an implementation of the server for the TIMEP protocol, as
#  described in RFC 868. This protocol can be used to ask servers like this
#  one for their current time-and-day. This is a cleaned up and rewritten
#  version of the original intimed 1.10 (12/12/93) that is included in
#  RedHat Linux. This version adds TIMEP over UDP support in compliance
#  with the RFC.
