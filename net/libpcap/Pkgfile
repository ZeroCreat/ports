# Description: A system-independent interface for user-level packet capture.
#  This is a handy little library which provides a packet filtering mechanism
#  based on the BSD packet filter (BPF). Most notably, tcpdump needs this
#  to work, and there is also a perl module (still in beta) which can use
#  this as well. In plain english, if you want to write your own network
#  traffic analyzer, this is the place to start.
