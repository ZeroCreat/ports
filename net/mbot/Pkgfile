# Description: Mbot is an IRC bot coded in C++
# Its main advantage is that several bots can run simultaneously in the
# same process, making it ideal for shells where the background processes
# are limited, but not the connections. It also features IPv6 support,
# TCL scripting partially compatible with eggdrop, and lots of modules
# with the most commonly needed functions.
