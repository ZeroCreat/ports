# Description: A powerful network and system monitor.
#  Nagios (formerly Netsaint) is a daemon written in C that is designed
#  to monitor networked hosts and services. It has the ability to notify
#  contacts (via email, pager or other methods) when problems arise
#  and are resolved. Host and service checks are performed by external
#  "plugins", making it easy to write custom checks in your language of
#  choice. Several CGIs are included in order to allow you to view the
#  current and historical status via a Web browser, and a WAP interface
#  is also provided to allow you to acknowlege problems and disable
#  notifications from an internet-ready cellphone.
