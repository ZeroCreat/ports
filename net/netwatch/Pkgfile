# Description: Ethernet Monitor
#  Netwatch allows a user to monitor an Ethernet segment or PPP line and
#  examine activity on the network. Hostnames are highlighted in colours to
#  indicate activity on the bus network based on time. The monitor includes
#  statistics on transmitted and received packets, transmitted and received
#  bytes, protocol of last packet (TX or RC), last communication partner
#  (IP address) and Logging entire stats to an ASCII file. There is a TOP
#  mode which allows a sorted list of hosts based on IP usage. All info is
#  updated on a per second basis.
