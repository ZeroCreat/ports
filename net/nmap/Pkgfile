# Description: A tool for network exploration, administration, and security scanning.
#  Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a utility for network exploration,
#  administration, and security auditing. It uses IP packets in novel ways to
#  determine which hosts are available online (host discovery), which TCP/UDP
#  ports are open (port scanning), and what applications and services are
#  listening on each port (version detection). It can also identify remote
#  host OS and device types via TCP/IP fingerprinting. Nmap offers flexible
#  target and port specifications, decoy/stealth scanning for firewall and
#  IDS evasion, and highly optimized timing algorithms for fast scanning.
