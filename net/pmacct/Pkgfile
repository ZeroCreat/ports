# Description: A libpcap, NetFlow, and sFlow IPv4/IPv6 accounting package.
# pmacct is a small set of passive network monitoring tools to measure,
# account, classify, aggregate, and export IPv4 and IPv6 traffic. A
# pluggable and flexible architecture allows collected network data to be
# stored into memory tables or SQL (MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL) databases and
# exported through NetFlow or sFlow protocols to remote collectors. pmacct
# supports fully customizable historical data breakdown, flow sampling,
# filtering and tagging, recovery actions, and triggers. Libpcap, sFlow
# v2/v4/v5 and NetFlow v1/v5/v7/v8/v9 are supported.
