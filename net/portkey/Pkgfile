# Description: A port-knocking daemon.
#  Portkey is a port-knocking daemon. It allows you to put a simple
#  combination lock on your TCP services and grant access to a port once
#  a client has supplied the correct combination. The combination is
#  supplied by attempting to connect to a specific sequence of closed TCP
#  ports within a configured time period. Access is later revoked after a
#  suitable timeout period.
