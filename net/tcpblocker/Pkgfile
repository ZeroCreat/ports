# Description: Blocks too many connections from clients to tcpserver services.
#  Tcpblocker is for sites that want to limit the number of times an IP
#  address can connect to a tcpserver controlled service like SMTP within
#  a time period. Each time tcpblock runs, it counts how many connections
#  were made per client IP. If an IP exceeds the configurable maximum
#  number of connections within the configurable time period, then tcpblock
#  outputs a standard deny line that can be used to build a tcp.smtp style
#  file. Combined with a cron job and a run script, tcpblocker can be
#  configured to fit into just about any qmail or tcpserver installation.
