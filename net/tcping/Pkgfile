# Description: Pings a server on a specific port using TCP/IP
#  tcping does a TCP connect to the given ip/port combination. The user can
#  specify a timeout in seconds. This is useful in shell scripts running in
#  firewalled environments. Often SYNs are just being dropped by firewalls,
#  thus connection establishment will be retried several times (for minutes)
#  until a TCP timeout is reached. With tcping it is possible to check first
#  if the desired port is reachable and then start connection establishment.
