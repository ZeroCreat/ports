# Description: trackpeer is an agent program that helps network and server administrators with tracking users' computers [1-3]. It makes it possible to determine the MAC addresses of computers over a network, even when the computers are behind NATed gateways. This agent program is intended to be used by the administrators who need to identify and locate malicious computers (users) and virus-infected computers in a network such as middle-sized Wireless LAN system, public ethernet jack system, and campus or corporate network. The program will also be useful for a simple MAC-address-based authentication over a network.
