# Description: An Embedded DHCP Server and Client.
#  udhcp Server/Client is an embedded DHCP client and server that can be
#  compiled seperately (19k and 17k respectively), or as one combined binary
#  (29k). The server stores its lease file periodically, or by a signal (for
#  systems with flash memory) in terms of absolute time of lease expiration,
#  or time remaining in a lease (for systems with no clocks). The client
#  calls helper scripts to do the work of configuring the interfaces for
#  more flexibility.
