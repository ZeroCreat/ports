# Description: A high performance hub for the ADC peer-to-peer network.
#  µHub is a high performance peer-to-peer hub designed for Unix-like
#  operating systems. It has a clean design and small memory footprint. It
#  is scalable, and will work for small hubs on embedded hardware, as well as
#  big hubs running on high preformance servers with thousands of users. µHub
#  uses the ADC protocol (i.e. the next generation Direct Connect), and is
#  compatible with DC++, Elise, QuickDC, and other ADC clients.
