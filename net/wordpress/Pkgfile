# Description: A standards-compliant Weblog/CMS.
#  WordPress is a state-of-the-art, semantic, personal publishing platform
#  with a focus on aesthetics, Web standards, and usability. It was born
#  out of a desire for an elegant, well-architected personal publishing
#  system. While primarily geared towards functioning as a Weblog, WordPress
#  is also a flexible CMS capable of managing many types of Web sites. In
#  addition to the basic blog functions, it also has an integrated link
#  manager (e.g. for blogrolls), file attachments, XFN support, support for
#  stand-alone pages, Atom and RSS feeds for both content and comments,
#  blogging API support (Atom Publishing Protocol, Blogger, MetaWeblog,
#  and Movable Type APIs), spam blocking features, advanced cruft-free URL
#  generation, a flexible theme system, and an advanced plugin API.
