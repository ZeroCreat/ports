# Description: Classes and routines for programming interactive 3D graphics with OpenGL.
#  Glt is a library of C++ classes and routines for programming interactive
#  3D graphics with OpenGL. The aim of Glt is to augment the OpenGL API with
#  convenient mechanisms for manipulating the OpenGL state machine. Glt
#  is a work in progress, and by no means covers the entire OpenGL
#  specification. However, it already includes several useful classes and
#  is designed so that additional classes can be added easily. In addition
#  to Glt, the GlutMaster classes provide C++ wrappers for the GLUT API.
