# Description: An exception handling library.
#  OSSP ex is a small ISO-C++ style exception handling library for use in
#  the ISO-C language. It allows you to use the paradigm of throwing and
#  catching exceptions in order to reduce the amount of error handling code
#  without making your program less robust. This is achieved by directly
#  transferring exceptional return codes (and the program control flow)
#  from the location where the exception is raised (throw point) to the
#  location where it is handled (catch point), usually from a deeply nested
#  sub-routine to a parent routine. All intermediate routines no longer
#  have to make sure that the exceptional return codes from sub-routines
#  are correctly passed back to the parent.
