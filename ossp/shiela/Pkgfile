# Description: Access Control and Logging Facility for CVS.
#  Shiela is an access control and logging facility for use with the
#  Concurrent Versions System (CVS). It is intended to be hooked into CVS's
#  processing through the $CVSROOT/CVSROOT/xxxinfo callbacks. This way
#  Shiela provides access control on a path and branch basis to particular
#  repository users and user groups. Additionally, repository operations
#  are monitored, accumulated, and logged. The lookout of logging messages
#  can be configured individually on a module path and branch basis and
#  messages can be both saved to files and/or delivered by email.
