# Description: A Perl database interface framework.
#  The DBI module enables your Perl applications to access multiple database
#  types transparently. You can connect to MySQL, MSSQL, Oracle, Informix,
#  Sybase, ODBC, and other database systems without having to know the
#  different underlying interfaces of each. The API defined by DBI will
#  work on all these database types and many more. You can connect to
#  multiple databases of different types at the same time and easily move
#  data between them.

# Maintainer: Roman Senn <rs@adfinis.com>
# Depends on:
