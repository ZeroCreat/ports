# Description: Perl module for correct formatting of dates in emails
# RFC 2822 defines the Date: header. It declares the header a required
# part of an email message. The syntax for date headers is clearly laid
# out. Still, even a perfectly planned world has storms. The truth is, many
# programs get it wrong. Very wrong. Or, they don't include a Date: header
# at all. This often forces you to look elsewhere for the date, and hoping
# to find something.
#
# For this reason, the tedious process of looking for a valid date has been
# encapsulated in this software. Further, the process of creating RFC
# compliant date strings is also found in this software.

# Maintainer: Roman Senn <rs@adfinis.com>
# Depends on: perl, libtime-piece-perl, libemail-abstract-perl, libtimedate-perl
