# Description: OOP interface to the Plesk Expand XML API
# At present the module provides interaction with Plesk Expand 2.2.4 (API
# 2.2.4.1). Complete support of operations with Accounts, partial support
# of work with domains. Support of addition of domains to user Accounts.
#
# API::PleskExpand module gives the convenient interface for addition
# of new functions. Extensions represent modules in a folder Plesk with
# definitions of demanded functions. Each demanded operation is described
# by two functions: op and op_response_parse. The first sub generates XML
# query to Plesk, the second is responsible for parse XML answer and its
# representation in Perl Native Structures. As a template for a writing
# of own expansions is better to use API/PleskExpand/Accounts.pm. In
# module API::Plesk::Methods we can find service functions for a writing
# our extensions.
