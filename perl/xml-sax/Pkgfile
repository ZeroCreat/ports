# Description: Perl module for using and building Perl SAX2 XML processors
#  This module consists of several framework classes for using and building
#  Perl SAX2 XML parsers, filters, and drivers. It is designed around the
#  need to be able to "plug in" different SAX parsers to an application
#  without requiring programmer intervention. Those of you familiar with
#  the DBI will be right at home. Some of the designs come from the Java
#  JAXP specification (SAX part), only without the javaness. . This package
#  also contains a script (called update-perl-sax-parsers) to manage the
#  ParserDetails.ini file. This script is intended to be used in postinst
#  and prerm package scripts to (de)register parsers. See README.Debian
#  for more info.
