# Description: Simple oo representation of an XML::LibXML DOM object
#  This is a short and simple class allowing simple object access to a parsed
#  XML::LibXML tree, with methods for fetching children and attributes in
#  as clean a manner as possible. . This is a small and quick module, with
#  easy and compact usage. Some will rightfully question placing another
#  interface over the DOM methods provided by XML::LibXML, but my experience
#  is that people appreciate the total simplicity provided by this module,
#  despite its limitations.
