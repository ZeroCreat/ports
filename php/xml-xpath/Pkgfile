# Description: XPath/DOM XML manipulation, maneuvering and query interface.
#  The PEAR::XML_XPath class provided an XPath/DOM XML manipulation,
#  maneuvering and query interface. The class allows for easy manipulation,
#  maneuvering and querying of a domxml tree using both xpath queries
#  and DOM walk functions. It uses an internal pointer for all methods
#  on which the action is performed. Results from an dom/xpath query are
#  returned as an XPath_Result object, which contains an internal array of
#  DOM nodes and which extends the common DOM class and hence contains all
#  the DOM functions from the main object to run on each of the elements
#  in the internal array. This class tries to hold as close as possible
#  to the DOM Recommendation. You MUST have the domxml extension to use
#  this class. The XML_XPath class was inspired by a class maintained
#  by Nigel Swinson called phpxpath. The phpxpath class does not rely
#  on PHP xmldom functions and is therefore a sibling to this class:
