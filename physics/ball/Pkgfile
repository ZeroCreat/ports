# Description: A framework for rapid application development in structural bioinformatics.
#  The Biochemical ALgorithms Library (BALL) is a framework for
#  rapid application development in molecular modeling and structural
#  bioinformatics. BALL provides an extensive set of data structures as
#  well as classes for molecular mechanics, advanced solvation methods,
#  comparison and analysis of protein structures, file import/export, NMR
#  shift prediction, and visualization. Its extensibility results from an
#  object-oriented and generic programming approach.
