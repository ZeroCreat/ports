# Description: A program for visualizing the amount of chaos in a certain physical system.
#  Chaos Visualization is a program for quickly calculating the amount of
#  predictability in a very simple system: a spring with one side connected
#  to the origin and the other to a weight under gravity. This amount is
#  chaos is visualized in TIFF images, which can be put in a sequence to
#  show the evolution of chaotic behaviour in this system.
