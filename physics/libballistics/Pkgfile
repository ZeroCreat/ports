# Description: An efficient external ballistics library.
#  libballistics is an external ballistics library which uses many
#  widely-accepted mathematical formulas to calculate the bullet path for
#  a given projectile. Functions are available to adjust for atmospheric
#  conditions, conversions, and stepped ballistic coefficients. libballistics
#  is very efficient and runs well on mobile devices. It is the engine used
#  in "Ballistic" for the iPhone.
