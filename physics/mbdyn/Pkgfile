# Description: MultiBody Dynamics analysis system
#  MBDyn features the integrated multidisciplinary analysis of multi-body,
#  multi-physics systems, including nonlinear mechanics of rigid and
#  flexible constrained bodies, smart materials, electric networks, active
#  control, hydraulic networks, and essential fixed-wing and rotorcraft
#  aerodynamics. It allows you to simulate the behavior of heterogeneous
#  mechanical, aero-servo-elastic systems based on first principles
#  equations. It is being actively developed and used in the aerospace
#  and automotive fields for dynamics analysis and simulation of complex
#  systems. The extension of available analysis domains to new models,
#  and new analysis domains, is planned and problem-driven.
