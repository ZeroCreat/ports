# Description: A utility to simplify the process of trying out new programs from source.
#  bpkg is a utility that tries to simplify the process of trying out
#  new programs from source. For most packages, this can be as simple
#  as "bpkg <url or tarball>". bpkg will download, extract, configure,
#  compile, install, generate a package in your system's native format,
#  and finally integrate that package into your system's packaging system
#  so that you can remove it cleanly. It has auto-detection for Arch Linux,
#  Slackware, Red Hat, Gentoo, and SuSE (though not all packaging back-ends
#  are complete). bpkg is not intended as a replacement for normal packaging
#  utilities.
