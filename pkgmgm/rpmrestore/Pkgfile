# Description: A program to restore file attributes to their state at the time of install.
#  Rpmrestore allows the user to show the differences (user, group, mode,
#  mtime, size) between a package's status on install and its current
#  status. This act as an improvement of the functionality provided by the
#  "rpm -V" command. It also allows the user to restore the attributes
#  to their original state (install state). It features a batch mode,
#  an interactive mode, a logfile, and rollback.
