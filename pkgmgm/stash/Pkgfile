# Description: A script that eases the installation of software into a user's home directory.
#  Stash is a package manager for non-root users. It makes it easier for
#  you to install, track, and maintain packages and modules in your home
#  directory. It does this by detecting the type of package or module you
#  are installing and passing all the correct command line arguments to
#  the relevant configure scripts and/or makefiles. It is extensible via
#  custom packages, and tracks both architecture dependent and independent
#  packages in separate directories so that they can be shared across
#  systems. Package tracking uses symlinks in a manner similar to GNU
#  stow. It supports autoconf, Perl and Python modules, imake (xmkmf), PMK,
#  and many custom packages.
