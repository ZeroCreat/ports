# Description: Tools to ease installation and management of third-party software.
#  swpkg is a collection of tools which allow a system administrator to
#  build, install, and maintain software packages on a system. It is based
#  on a fairly simple philosophy intended to simplify the management of
#  third party software and their inter-dependencies.
