# Description: A tool to query many Linux, BSD, and Fink/MacPorts repositories.
#  whohas is a command line tool that allows you to query several package
#  collections at once. It currently supports Arch Linux (and AUR), Debian,
#  Fedora, Gentoo, Mandriva, openSUSE, Slackware (and linuxpackages.net),
#  Source Mage Linux, Ubuntu, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Fink, and
#  MacPorts repositories. whohas was designed to help package maintainers
#  find ebuilds, pkgbuilds, and similar package definitions from other
#  distributions to learn from. However, it can also be used by normal
#  users who want to know which distribution provides certain packages,
#  and which version of a given package is in use in each distribution or
#  in each release of a distribution.
