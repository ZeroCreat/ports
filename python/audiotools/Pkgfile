# Description: A collection of audio handling utilities.
#  Python Audio Tools is a collection of audio handling programs that work
#  from the command line. These include programs for CD extraction, track
#  conversion from one audio format to another, track renaming and retagging,
#  track identification, CD burning from tracks, and more. It supports
#  internationalized track filenames and metadata using Unicode. It works
#  with high-definition, multi-channel audio as well as CD-quality. Track
#  conversion uses multiple CPUs or CPU cores if available to greatly speed
#  the transcoding process. Track metadata can be retrieved from FreeDB
#  or FreeDB-compatible servers. Audio formats supported are WAV, FLAC,
#  WavPack, MP3, Ogg Vorbis, M4A, and more.
