# Description: Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.
#  Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid
#  development and clean, pragmatic design. Developed and used over two years
#  by a fast-moving online-news operation, Django was designed to handle
#  two challenges: the intensive deadlines of a newsroom and the stringent
#  requirements of the experienced Web developers who wrote it. It lets you
#  build high-performing, elegant Web applications quickly. Django focuses
#  on automating as much as possible and adhering to the DRY principle.
