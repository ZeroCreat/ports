# Description: Light-weight toolkit for XML processing
#  ElementTree provides a simple but flexible container object, designed
#  to store hierarchical data structures, such as simplified XML infosets,
#  in memory. The element type can be described as a hybrid between a Python
#  list and a Python dictionary.
#  ElementTree is included in Python 2.5, so there is no need to install
#  this package if you are using Python 2.5.
