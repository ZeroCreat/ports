# Description: The Python specializing compiler.
#  Psyco shows that it is possible to execute Python code at speeds
#  approaching that of fully compiled languages, by using a technique called
#  "specialization". This extension module for the unmodified interpreter
#  accelerates user programs with little or no change in their sources. It
#  can increase speed by a factor that can be very interesting, and an
#  increase of 2 to 10 times is common.
