# Description: compile native-code modules for Python from Python-like syntax
#  Pyrex lets you write code that mixes Python and C data types any way
#  you want, and compiles it into a C extension for Python.
#  You can get very large speedups for tasks that don't need all the dynamic
#  features of Python, with very small differences in syntax and much less
#  hassle than writing your modules from scratch in C.
