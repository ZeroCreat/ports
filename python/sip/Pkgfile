# Description: Python/C++ bindings generator
#  SIP is a tool for generating bindings for C++ classes with some ideas
#  borrowed from SWIG, but capable of tighter bindings, because it's specific
#  to C++ and Python.
#  produced by it, you will also need python-sip4-dev.
#  SIP was originally designed to generate Python bindings for KDE and so
#  has explicit support for the signal slot mechanism used by the Qt/KDE
#  class libraries.
#  - connecting Qt signals to Python functions and class methods
#  - connecting Python signals to Qt slots
#  - overloading virtual member functions with Python class methods
#  - protected member functions
#  - abstract classes
#  - enumerated types
#  - global class instances
#  - static member functions.
