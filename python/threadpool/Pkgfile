# Package: python-threadpool
#
# Description: Easy to use object-oriented thread pool framework
#  A thread pool is an object that maintains a pool of worker threads to
#  perform time consuming operations in parallel. It assigns jobs to the
#  threads by putting them in a work request queue, where they are picked up
#  by the next available thread. This then performs the requested operation
#  in the background and puts the results in a another queue. The thread pool
#  object can then collect the results from all threads from this queue as
#  soon as they become available or after all threads have finished their
#  work. It's also possible, to define callbacks to handle each result as
#  it comes in.
