# Description: A Python iCalendar library
#  vobject is intended to be a full featured Python package for parsing and
#  generating vCard and vCalendar files. It is being developed in concert
#  with the Open Source Application Foundation's Chandler project. Currently,
#  iCalendar files are supported and well tested. vCard 3.0 files are
#  supported, and all data should be imported, but only a few components are
#  understood in a sophisticated way. The Calendar Server team has added
#  VAVAILABILITY support to vobject's iCalendar parsing. Please report
#  bugs by entering them in the OSAF Bugzilla, product vobject. vobject is
#  licensed under the Apache 1.1 license.
