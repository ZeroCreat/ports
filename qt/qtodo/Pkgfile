# Description: A todo-list manager.
#  QTodo is a todo-list manager that was designed to help the user to
#  actually get things done. You can add todo items to different lists,
#  set priorities, the status of an item, deadlines, and more. Items can
#  be sorted, filtered, copied, cut, and pasted. The lists can be printed
#  to paper. It also features deadline management with alerts that you can
#  fine-tune or just disable with a tray icon.
