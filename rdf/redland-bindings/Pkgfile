# Description: Redland is a library that provides a high-level interface
# for the Resource Description Framework (RDF) allowing the RDF graph to
# be parsed from XML, stored, queried and manipulated. Redland implements
# each of the RDF concepts in its own class via an object based API,
# reflected into the language APIs, currently C#, Java, Perl, PHP, Obj-C,
# Python, Ruby and Tcl. Several classes providing functionality such as
# for parsers, storage are built as modules that can be loaded at compile
# or run-time as required.
# The redland-bindings package provides the higher level language APIs to
# Redland in the following languages: C#, Java, Obj-C, Perl, PHP, Python,
# Ruby, Tcl
