# Description: Simple modular application for data investigation.
#  This is an application to help user (mathematician) to make
#  regression between series of data, draw grpahics, and export them into
#  various formats by means of common graphics packages (i.e., gnuplot,
#  plotutils). It is written in Python. The user interfeace is built upon
#  the wxPython (wxWindows) widget set. The idea of usage is as follows:
#  the user builds a project which is represented as a tree of modules;
#  modules can generate data variables, as well as consume them. Essentialy,
#  such a tree represents an algorithm of data analysis. The system is
#  intended to educate students.
