# Description: Personal search and metasearch tools.
#  Pinot is a D-Bus service that crawls, indexes your documents, and monitors
#  them for changes. It is also a GTK-based user interface that enables you
#  to query the index built by the service or your favorite Web engine,
#  and display and analyze the results. It makes full use of advanced
#  indexing and search facilities offered by Xapian, features language
#  detection, dynamic document summaries, easy labelling of documents,
#  and internal support for common file types. The D-Bus interface allows
#  easy integration with other applications.
