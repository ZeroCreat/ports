# Description: A "locate" command that is always up-to-date.
#  rlocate is an implementation of the "locate" command that is always
#  up-to-date. The database that the original locate uses is usually updated
#  only once a day, so newer files cannot be located right away. The behavior
#  of rlocate is the same as slocate, but it also maintains a diff database
#  that gets updated whenever a file is created or a directory is moved. The
#  rlocate kernel module can be compiled only with Linux 2.6 kernels.
