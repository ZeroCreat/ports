# Description: File indexing and searching engine (typically used for web servers).
# SWISH++ is a Unix-based file indexing and searching engine (typically
# used to index and search files on web sites). It was based on SWISH-E
# although SWISH++ is a complete rewrite. SWISH++ is at least 10 times
# faster and can handle much larger numbers of files. Additionally, it
# has unique features such as selective non-indexing, on-the-fly filters,
# user-selectable stemming, and more.
