# Description: Three pipeable shell utilities for dealing with paths and filenames.
#  The Aardvark Shell Utils is a collection of three utilities designed
#  to aid the user when working with shell scripts or from the command
#  line. All three accept input on the command line or from standard input,
#  and thus they can be piped with other commands. All commands come with
#  their own man page. Included are realpath, filebase, and fileext.
