# Description: Bash completion library
#  This project splits the bash completion package of Ian Macdonald (see:
#  http://www.caliban.org/bash/index.shtml#completion) into multiple
#  files. The objectives of this project are that bash completion:
#
#    * should load faster
#    * should consume less memory
#    * should have an open development environment
#    * should have automated tests
#
#  bash-completion-lib loads 4 times faster as does the single
#  file bash completion package. Functions are loaded run-time for only
#  those commands you actually complete - the moment you press TAB.
#  After the first completion, the completion function is installed and
#  stays in memory for fast subsequent completions.
#  DejaGnu is used to run automated tests.
