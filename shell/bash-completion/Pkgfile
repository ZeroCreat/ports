# Description: programmable completion for the bash shell
#  Since v2.04, bash has allowed you to intelligently program
#  and extend its standard completion behavior to achieve complex command
#  lines with just a few keystrokes. Imagine typing ssh [Tab] and being able
#  to complete on hosts from your ~/.ssh/known_hosts files. Or typing man 3
#  str [Tab] and getting a list of all string handling functions in the UNIX
#  manual. mount system: [Tab] would complete on all exported file-systems
#  from the host called system, while make [Tab] would complete on all targets
#  in Makefile. This project was conceived to produce programmable completion
#  routines for the most common Linux/UNIX commands, reducing the amount of
#  typing sysadmins and programmers need to do on a daily basis.
