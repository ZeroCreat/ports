# Description: The Bourne shell, as found on traditional Unix systems.
# The Heirloom Bourne Shell is a portable variant of the traditional Unix
# shell. It is especially suitable for testing the portability of shell
# scripts and for processing legacy scripts. The Bourne shell does not
# provide as many features as newer Unix shells, but it does provide a
# stable shell language. With this in mind, it is also suitable for general
# script processing and interactive use. This variant of the Bourne shell
# has been derived from OpenSolaris code and thus provides the SVR4/SVID3
# level of the shell.
