# Description: POSIX-compliant shell
#  The Debian Almquist Shell (dash) is a lightweight POSIX-compliant shell
#  derived from ash.
#  It can be usefully installed as /bin/sh (because it executes scripts
#  faster than bash), or as the default shell for the superuser. It depends
#  on fewer libraries than bash, and is therefore less likely to be affected
#  by an upgrade problem or a disk failure. It is also useful for checking
#  the POSIX compliance of scripts. POSIX-compliant shell The Debian Almquist
