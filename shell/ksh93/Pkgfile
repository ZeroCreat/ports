# Description: The real, AT&T version of the Korn shell
#  Ksh is a UNIX command interpreter (shell) that is intended for both
#  interactive and shell script use. Its command language is a superset of
#  the sh(1) shell language.
#  The 1993 version adds a number of new, mostly scripting related, features
#  over the 1988 version that is typically distributed with commercial
#  UNIX variants. For example, it has lexical scoping, compound variables,
#  associative arrays, named references and floating point math.
