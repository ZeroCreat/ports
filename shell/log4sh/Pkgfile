# Package: liblog4sh
# Section: libs
# Description: A shell script logging framework similar to log4j.
#  log4sh is a logging framework for shell scripts that works similar to
#  the other wonderful logging products available from the Apache Software
#  Foundation (e.g. log4j, log4perl). Although not as powerful as the others,
#  it can make the task of adding advanced logging to a shell script easier,
#  and has much more power than just using simple amp;quot;echoamp;quot;
#  commands throughout. In addition, it can be configured from a properties
#  file so that scripts in a production environment do not need to be
#  altered to change the amount of logging they produce.
