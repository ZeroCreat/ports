# Description: A bash function library that provides quot;makequot; functionality to the shell.
#  The Mknew Project is an investigation of how to build simple Unix shell
#  scripts to manage common development and administrative tasks. The
#  emphasis is on using languages and tools that already exist and are
#  in common use. A related emphasis is on exploring the functional
#  programming nature of the bash shell. This is accomplished by using
#  the bash function capability, and using the bash "$(" ")"syntax to delay
#  function execution in bash scripts. This allows building scripts that have
#  a LISP-like function syntax that permits shell scripts to be written as
#  a series of function calls with minimal syntax. The goal is to provide
#  a way to specify make procedures of heterogeneous components in a bash
#  script. These can include diverse source code languages, documentation
#  text, test procedures, and data. In addition to the mknew function library
#  (mklib), these "make" procedures rely only on capabilities provided by
#  the bash shell, and common Unix command line utilities.
