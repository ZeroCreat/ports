# Description: A (non-interactive) scripting language, like sh; but its
# syntax is quite different from a traditional shell syntax. The execlineb
# program is meant to be used as an interpreter for a text file; the other
# commands are essentially useful inside an execlineb script.
# execline is now as powerful as a shell: it features conditional loops,
# getopt-style option handling, filename globbing, and more. Meanwhile,
# its syntax is far more logic and predictable than the shell's syntax,
# and has no security issues.
