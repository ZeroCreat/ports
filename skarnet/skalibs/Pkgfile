# Description: A package centralizing the public-domain C development
# files I use for building other software: it contains essentially
# general-purpose libraries. You will need to install skalibs if you plan to
# build skarnet.org software. The point is that you won't have to download
# and compile big libraries everytime you need to build a package: do it
# only once.
