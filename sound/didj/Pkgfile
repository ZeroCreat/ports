# Description: BPM measurement software and a music player.
#  Divine Intervention consists of two programs. The first is a very accurate
#  BPM measurement tool. The second is a player which can change the tempo
#  of music. The player allows nudging, forward and backward movement by
#  measures, and other nice things.
