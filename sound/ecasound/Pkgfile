# Description: Sound processing, multitrack recording, and mixing tools.
#  Ecasound is a software package designed for multitrack audio
#  processing. It can be used for simple tasks like audio playback,
#  recording, and format conversions, as well as for multitrack effect
#  processing, mixing, recording and signal recycling. It supports a wide
#  range of audio inputs, outputs, and effect algorithms. Effects and
#  audio objects can be combined in various ways, and their parameters
#  can be controlled by operator objects like oscillators and MIDI-CCs. A
#  versatile console-mode user interface is included in the package.
