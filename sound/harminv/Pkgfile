# Description: Harmonic inversion of time-signals
#  Harminv is a free program and C library for harmonic inversion:
#  decomposing a time-series into a sum of sinusoids, including exponentially
#  decaying sinusoids. It is based on the "filter diagonalization method"
#  (FDM) of Mandelshtam  Taylor, which maps the harmonic inversion
#  problem onto a small eigen-problem (size proportional to the number of
#  sinusoids). The FDM is often able to obtain much more robust and accurate
#  solutions than alternative methods.
