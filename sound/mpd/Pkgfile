# Description: A jukebox server that controls music playback (MP3, Ogg, Flac, AAC, Mod, wave).
#  Music Player Daemon (MPD) is a server that allows remote access for
#  playing music (MP3, Ogg Vorbis, FLAC, AAC, Mod, and wave) and managing
#  playlists. It makes a great desktop player with frontend options (Qt, GTK,
#  ncurses, Windows, and Web clients are available). It is also appropriate
#  as a console player that is scriptable, and is especially useful if X
#  is restarted frequently. A set of rapid development tools for clients
#  are being developed and include a C library, Python module, PHP class,
#  Perl module, and Java Class. The goals are to be easy to install and
#  use, to have minimal resource requirements, to be stable and flexible,
#  and easy to interface.
