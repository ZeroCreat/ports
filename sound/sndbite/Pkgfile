# Description: A tool for efficiently breaking audio files into smaller components.
#  SndBite is a specialized audio editor designed for breaking large
#  recordings into smaller components with great efficiency. Its principal
#  intended application is in linguistic research where it is often
#  desirable to put each word or sentence into a separate file before
#  further processing. It is also useful for measuring pause durations. Its
#  features include multiple simultaneous views of the waveform at different
#  resolutions, the ability to position window edges at transitions between
#  sound and silence, automated setting of cut points at zero-crossings,
#  automatic filename generation easily controlled by the user, and optional
#  automatic playback on window motion. It is scriptable and may be run in
#  batch mode without the GUI.
