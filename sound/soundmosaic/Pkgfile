# Description: Constructs an approximation of one sound out of small pieces of other sounds.
#  Soundmosaic constructs an approximation of one sound out of small pieces
#  of other sounds. The soundmosaic algorithm is: split the target file up
#  into equal-sized segments, or "tiles". For each tile in the target file,
#  find the closest match in the source files, and replace the target tile
#  with the tile from the source files.
