# Description: A program that holds musical instruments for you to play.
#  Soundtank is a program that hosts musical instruments for you to play;
#  each instrument can be controlled via MIDI. You can create custom
#  instruments and save them to files, and can also load instruments that
#  other people create. It relies on LADSA plugins, as it has no built-in
#  sound synthesis algorithms, but hosts them in "realtime objects" which
#  embody the structure of the audio signal flow. RTObjects can be controlled
#  in a completely customizable fashion using MIDI events sent through the
#  ALSA sequencer interface. Soundtank outputs audio through ALSA or JACK.
