# Description: A purely algorithmic string synthesizer with ASCII input and wav output.
#  Twibright Syntring is a purely algorithmic string synthesizer with ASCII
#  tab input and wav output. It doesn't use any samples, yet sounds quite
#  realistic. Timbre, volume, and timing are adjustable in the tab file. It
#  can be used for learning or practicing guitar or bass playing, for editing
#  and synthesizing one's own tunes, or producing MIDI sound fonts. It is
#  very lightweight and portable, and doesn't require any libraries.
