# Description: Play sounds in response to network traffic
#  The tcpsound(1) utility will play sounds in response to network traffic
#  permitting a user to literally listen to a network. Specifically tcpsound
#  forks a pseudo terminal in which to run tcpdump(8), parses that output,
#  and plays a wide variety of user configuable sounds. Interpreting the
#  output of tcpdump in a pty permits tcpsound to first ssh(1) to a remote
#  host if desired.
