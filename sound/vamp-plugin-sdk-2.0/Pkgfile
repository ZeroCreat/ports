# Section: universe/sound
# Description: audio analysis and feature extraction plugins (SDK)
#  Vamp is an audio processing plugin system for plugins that extract
#  descriptive information from audio data - typically referred to as audio
#  analysis plugins or audio feature extraction plugins.
#  Just like an audio effects plugin (such as a VST), a Vamp plugin is a
#  binary module that can be loaded up by a host application and fed audio
#  data. However, unlike an effects plugin, a Vamp plugin outputs not
#  processed audio but some sort of symbolic information. Typical things
#  that a Vamp plugin might calculate include the locations of moments
#  such as note onset times, visual representations of the audio such as
#  histograms, or curve data such as power or fundamental frequency.
#  Hosts using Vamp plugins include Audacity and Sonic Visualiser.
#  This package contains C and C++ header files for developing Vamp plugins
#  and hosts, API documentation, and source code of example plugins and a
#  simple host.
