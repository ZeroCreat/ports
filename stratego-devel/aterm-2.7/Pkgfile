# Description: Data type (Tree) for exchange in distributed applications
#  ATerm (short for Annotated Term) is an abstract data type designed
#  for the exchange of tree-like data structures between distributed
#  applications. . The ATerm library forms a comprehensive procedural
#  interface which enables creation and manipulation of ATerms in
#  C. The ATerm implementation is based on maximal subterm sharing and
#  automatic garbage collection. . A binary exchange format for the concise
#  representation of ATerms (sharing preserved) allows the fast exchange
#  of ATerms between applications. In a typical application---parse trees
#  which contain considerable redundant information---less than 2 bytes are
#  needed to represent a node in memory, and less than 2 bits are needed
#  to represent it in binary format. The implementation of ATerms scales
#  up to the manipulation of ATerms in the giga-byte range.
