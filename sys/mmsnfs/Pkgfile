# Description: A method of distributing an entire filesystem among several machines.
#  Multicasting Master-Slave Network Filesystem is a method of distributing
#  an entire filesystem among several client machines simultaneously
#  and efficiently. It provides mechanisms for modifying a distributed
#  filesystem structure reliably, and for securing it against introducing
#  inconsistencies. It is designed to be used in small networks of similarly
#  configured machines, such as university labs or Internet cafes.
