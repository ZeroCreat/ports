# Description: A growable text/string buffer object creation and manipulation library.
#  Libtext is a C library for creating, reading, and performing operations on
#  growable text / string buffer objects with optional error callbacks. The
#  library performs actions such as append, delete, find, get, insert,
#  prepend, replace, and reverse. Libtext can also append, insert, overwrite,
#  and prepend printf style formats. Further options include rejecting binary
#  characters, setting a maximum size, and setting a mask that controls
#  for which errors the callback will be executed for each individual
#  object. The API is simple enough to learn and use within minutes, but
#  can be used to build more complex routines.
