# Description: A Web application server for C++.
#  Tntnet is a Web application server for generating Web applications in
#  C++. HTML pages with some additional tags for inclusion of C++ code are
#  compiled into shared libraries and served from tntnet. It resembles PHP,
#  JSP, or Mason, but the programming language used is C++, and the pages are
#  compiled into native code before serving. Tntnet is fully multithreaded
#  and supports HTTP keep-alive for best performance. Its dynamic pages
#  are faster than static pages with other Web servers, while creating Web
#  applications is simple.
