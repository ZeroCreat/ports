# Description: A simple documentation markup language for HTML/LaTeX/etc.
#  AFT (Almost Free Text) is a document preparation system. It is mostly free
#  form, meaning that there is little intrusive markup; AFT source documents
#  look a lot like plain old ASCII text. It has a few rules for structuring
#  your document, more to do with formatting your text than embedding lots
#  of commands, and it produces all types of output (HTML, XHTML, LaTeX,
#  roll-your-own XML, etc.). All that needs to be done is to edit a rule
#  file. You can even customize your own rule files for specialized output.
