# Description: A script for managing file archives of various types.
#  atool is a script for managing file archives of various types (tar,
#  tar+gzip, zip etc). The main command is aunpack, which extracts
#  files from an archive. It overcomes the problem of extracting files
#  from an archive without checking whether the files were located in a
#  subdirectory or in the top directory of the archive, resulting in files
#  scattered all over the place by first extracting to a new directory. If
#  there was only a single file in the archive, that file is moved to the
#  original directory. It also prevents local files from being overwritten
#  by mistake. The other commands are apack for creating archives, als for
#  listing files in archives, and acat for extracting files to standard out.
