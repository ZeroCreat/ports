# Description: A monitor for system resources and process activity.
#  Atop is an ASCII full-screen performance monitor that is capable of
#  reporting the activity of all processes (even if processes have finished
#  during the interval), daily logging of system and process activity
#  for long-term analysis, highlighting overloaded system resources by
#  using colors, etc. At regular intervals, it shows system-level activity
#  related to the CPU, memory, swap, disks, and network layers, and for
#  every active process it shows the CPU utilization, the memory growth,
#  priority, username, state, and exit code.
