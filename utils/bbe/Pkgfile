# Description: A sed-like editor for binary files.
#  bbe is a sed-like editor for binary files. Instead of reading input
#  in lines as sed, bbe reads arbitrary blocks from an input stream and
#  performs byte-related transformations on found blocks. Blocks can be
#  defined using start/stop strings, stream offset and block length,
#  or a combination. Basic editing commands include delete, replace,
#  search/replace, binary operations (and, or, etc.), append, and bcd/ASCII
#  conversion. For examining the input stream, it contains some grep-like
#  features like printing the input file name, stream offset, and block
#  number of found blocks. Block contents can also be printed in different
#  formats like hex, octal, ASCII, and binary.
