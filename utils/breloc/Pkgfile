# Description: A small program that does binary edits on files to relocate compiled-in prefixes
# It is padding it with extra slashes to make up for differences in the length
# of the prefixes.
# In order for breloc to be most effective, a binary package should be configured
# with a prefix that has a lot of extra slashes at the end of it.
