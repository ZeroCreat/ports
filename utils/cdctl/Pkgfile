# Description: Controls your CD-ROM drive under linux.
#  cdctl is a program similar to eject. Like eject, it can eject your
#  CD-ROM/DVD drive, but it does a whole lot more. Cdctl provides a user
#  interface to the 2.2 kernel's uniform cdrom driver's ioctl calls, and
#  most 2.0 cdrom drivers (ide-cd and scsi). Cdctl is also capable of doing
#  everything a regular console cd player can as well as drive capability
#  interrogation, autoeject setting, maximum/mininum speed cap setting,
#  disc-changer disc selection, disc status readback, MCN querying, table
#  of contents header readback, track header readback, and much more.
