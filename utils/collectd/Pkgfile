# Description: A system statistics collection daemon.
#  collectd is a small and modular daemon which collects system information
#  periodically and provides means to store the values. Included in the
#  distribution are numerous plug-ins for collecting CPU, disk, and memory
#  usage, network interface and DNS traffic, network latency, database
#  statistics, and much more. Custom statistics can easily be added in a
#  number of ways, including execution of arbitrary programs and plug-ins
#  written in Perl. Advanced features include a powerful network code
#  to collect statistics for entire setups and SNMP integration to query
#  network equipment.
