# Description: A history mechanism for selections.
#  cutview detects changes in the contents of the current selection or
#  cutbuffer0 and stores them in a buffer, which also displays the contents
#  on the screen. The user can edit or print the contents of a buffer from
#  a menu. The contents of a buffer can also be locked so that the contents
#  persist across X sessions. cutview mirrors cutbuffer0 to the selection,
#  and vice-versa, enabling some tools which don't use selections, e.g.,
#  VNC to work.
