# Description: Turns other processes into daemons.
#  daemon turns other processes into daemons. There are many tedious tasks
#  that need to be performed to correctly set up a daemon process; daemon
#  performs these tasks for other processes. This is useful for writing
#  daemons in languages other than C, C++, or Perl (e.g. sh, Java). If you
#  want to write daemons in languages that can link against C functions
#  (e.g. C, C++), see libslack, which contains the core functionality
#  of daemon.
