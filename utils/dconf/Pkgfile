# Description: A tool to collect and store a system's hardware and software configuration.
#  Dconf is a tool to collect a system's hardware and software
#  configuration. It allows you to take your system configuration with you
#  and compare systems (like nodes in a cluster) to troubleshoot hardware
#  or software problems. It can also be configured to send out configuration
#  changes at given intervals to a group of people, or store a new snapshot
#  when system changes happen.
