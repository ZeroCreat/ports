# Description: Run a single command on many hosts.
#  dsh (the distributed shell) is a program which executes a single command
#  on multiple remote machines. It can execute this command in parallel 
#  (i.e., on any number of machines at a time) or in serial (by specifying 
#  parallel execution of the command on 1 node at a time). 
#  It was originally designed to work with rsh, but has full support for ssh
#  and with a little tweaking of the top part of the dsh executable, should 
#  work with any program that allows remote execution of a command without 
#  an interactive login.
