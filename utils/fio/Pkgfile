# Description: fio is an I/O tool meant to be used both for benchmark and
# stress/hardware verification. It has support for 12 different types of I/O
# engines (sync, mmap, libaio, posixaio, SG v3, splice, null, network, syslet,
# guasi, and more), I/O priorities (for newer Linux kernels), rate I/O, forked
# or threaded jobs, and much more. It can work on block devices as well as
# files. fio accepts job descriptions in a simple-to-understand text format.
# Several example job files are included. fio displays all sorts of I/O
# performance information. It supports Linux, FreeBSD, and OpenSolaris.
