# Description: A tool used by developers to store/retrieve package meta-data.
#  Flagpoll is a tool for developers to use meta-data files for storing
#  information on what is needed to compile their software. Think of it as
#  the rpm of software development. It provides developers with total control
#  over which packages, versions, architectures, et cetera that they want
#  to use meta-data from. Instead of specifying other packages' cflags and
#  ldflag manually, you can call `flagpoll mylib --cflags --ldflags` and
#  it will retrieve the flags for its package as well as its dependencies.
