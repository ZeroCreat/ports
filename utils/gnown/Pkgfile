# Description: An abstract knowledge management tool.
#  Gnown is an abstract knowledge management tool. According to theory, one
#  can organize knowledge into one of three distinct structures: the tree
#  (like an outline or taxonomy), the list (a sequence, or shopping list)
#  and the graph (an arbitrary set of links, like the index of a book). Gnown
#  is an ncurses-based tool that lets you organize information into these
#  simple structures and navigate through them efficiently. It stores the
#  data in an easy to read directory structure intended to ease additional
#  processing by other applications.
