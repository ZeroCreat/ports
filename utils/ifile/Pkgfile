# Description: A text/e-mail/spam filter capable of learning
#  A text filter that uses machine learning to classify texts into
#  groups. ifile works great as a spam filter. The text is classified
#  by a simple statistical method called Naive Bayes, which basically
#  considers each text an unordered collection of words and classifies
#  by matching the distribution with the most closely matching group
#  distribution. Alternatives to ifile are annoyance-filter, bogofilter,
#  spamoracle, and spamprobe.
