# Description: A lava lamp of currently running processes
#  LavaPS is an interactive process-tracking program like "top", but with
#  a much different attitude. Rather than presenting lots of specific info
#  in digital form, it tries to present certain important information in a
#  graphical analog form. The idea is that you can run it in the background
#  and get a rough idea of what's happening to your system without devoting
#  much concentration to the task. Lavaps was inspired the idea of calm
#  computing from "The Coming Age of Calm Technology" by Mark Weiser and
#  John Seely Brown.
