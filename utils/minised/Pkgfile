# Description: A fast, small sed implementation for constrained environments.
# minised is the fast, small sed originally distributed in the GNU toolkit
# and still distributed with Minix. The members of the GNU Project removed
# it when they built their own sed around an enhanced regexp package,
# but it's still better for some uses (in particular, it's faster and
# less memory-intensive).
