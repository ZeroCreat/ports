# Description: More Unix utilities.
# moreutils is a growing collection of the Unix tools that nobody thought
# to write thirty years ago. It includs utilities to get network interface
# information, to mark standard input with time stamps, to check whether
# a data stream is UTF-8, to combine the lines in two files using boolean
# operations, to soak up standard input and write to a file, to edit a
# directory in your text editor, to insert a text editor into a pipe,
# and to tee standard input to pipes.
