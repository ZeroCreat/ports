# Description: List processes using a mount point.
#  muser lists processes which have a given directory (or cwd if not
#  specified) as a parent of their current working directory (thus making it
#  impossible to unmount that directory if it is a mount point). This script
#  has overlapping functionality with the fuser program from the psmisc
#  package, but has the advantage that it works on SMB mounts. Additionally,
#  it provides a color, formatted listing of process IDs, executable names,
#  current working directories, and the command lines used to run the
#  programs. It works with varying-sized /proc/*/cwd fields.
