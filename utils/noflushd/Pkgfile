# Description: Daemon that sends idle disks to sleep (for kernels 2.2.11+)
#  noflushd is a simple daemon that monitors disk activity, spins down
#  disks whose idle time exceeds a certain timeout, and stops writes to
#  them in order to keep them spun down as long as possible. It's mainly
#  used on laptops to save power, but can also be useful to desktop users
#  with noisy hard disks. noflushd requires a kernel thread named kupdate
#  which is present in Linux kernel version 2.2.11 and later. For earlier
#  kernels, bdflush version 1.6 provides equal functionality.
