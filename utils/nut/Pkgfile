# Description: Nutrition software to analyze meals with the USDA Nutrient Database.
#  nut is nutrition software to record what you eat and analyze your
#  meals for nutrient composition. The database included is the latest
#  USDA Nutrient Database for Standard Reference. This database contains
#  values for vitamins, minerals, fats, calories, protein, carbohydrates,
#  fiber, etc., and includes the essential polyunsaturated fats, Omega-3
#  and Omega-6. Nutrient levels are expressed as a percentage of the Daily
#  Value, the familiar standard of food labeling in the United States, but
#  also can be fully customized. Foods can be added from recipes or food
#  labels, and nutrient intake can be graphed. The program is completely
#  menu-driven and there are no commands to learn.
