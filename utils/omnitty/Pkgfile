#
# Description: A curses-based program that allows one to log into several machines simultaneously and interact with them, selectively directing input to individual machines or groups of selected machines
#
# You can run both line-oriented and screen oriented in the target machines,
# because Omnitty has built-in terminal emulation capability. When the
# window is large enough, Omnitty also displays a "summary area" for each
# machine, in which it shows what the latest output from the machine was,
# so you can have an idea of what is going on in each machine.
#
# URL: http://omnitty.sourceforge.net/
# Maintainer: Roman Senn <rs@adfinis.com>
# Depends on: libc6, libncurses5, librote0
