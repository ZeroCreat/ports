# Description: otl is a text processor for generating custom markup from plain text. Much of both the input and output formats can be customized. LaTeX and HTML support are included in the distribution. One can specify other output formats, if desired. The user can also specify another input format if the default input format (roughly similar to that of asciidoc) does not meet his/her needs. otl supports complex structures such as nested ordered lists, headers and footers, and tables.
