# Description: Manipulate PATH-like environment variables
#  path can be used to manipulate a colon-separated list of paths contained
#  in an environment variable such as PATH. New paths can be added either
#  to the beginning or the end of the path list, paths can be removed from
#  the path list, and several checks can be made on the paths contained in
#  the path list. All duplicate paths in the list are removed.
