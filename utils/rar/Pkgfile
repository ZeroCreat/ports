# Description: A general purpose archiving and compression program
#  RAR is a general purpose archiving and compression program competing
#  with/replacing programs such as PKZip, ARJ and others. RAR offers
#  significantly improved compression ratios, easier use and a better price
#  as well as supporting long file names, disk spanning and self-extracting
#  file creation. RAR introduces an original compression algorithm. It allows
#  higher compression ratios than other PC archiving tools, especially on
#  executable files, Object libraries, large text files, etc.
