# Description: A set of programs to make renaming of files easier.
# The file renaming utilities (renameutils for short) are a set of programs
# designed to make renaming of files faster and less cumbersome. qmv
# ("quick move") allows file names to be edited in a text editor. The
# names of all files in a directory are written to a text file, which
# is then edited by the user. The text file is read and parsed, and the
# changes are applied to the files. qcp copies files instead of renaming
# them. imv ("interactive move"), is trivial but useful when you are too
# lazy to type (or even complete) the name of the file to rename twice. It
# allows a file name to be edited in the terminal using the GNU Readline
# library. Similarly, icp copies files instead of renaming them.
