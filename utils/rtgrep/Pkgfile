# Description: A recursive timestamp-sensitive grep.
#  rtgrep is a bash script which searches for all files located in the
#  current directory or a given base directory which were created or
#  modified within a given time period. The search can be recursive, and
#  you can specify a pattern to be matched in the file contents.
