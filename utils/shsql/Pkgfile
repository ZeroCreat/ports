# Description: An embeddable SQL-like DBMS that stores data tables in plain ASCII text files.
#  SHSQL is a standalone SQL database that stores data in ASCII text
#  files. It has a small memory footprint and code size and can be
#  embedded directly into applications; there is no server process. SHSQL
#  is a pared-down SQL implementation but retains useful features such as
#  timeout record locking and search engine comparison operators. A shsql
#  database can be updated via SQL, or by editing data files with a text
#  editor. Applications link to the supplied "C" language API. There is
#  also a command-line SQL utility.
