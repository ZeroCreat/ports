# Description: Designed to give stat() info to shell scripts
#  SHSTAT is like the stat command and the stat() function except that it's
#  designed for use in shell scripts. The tar.gz file contains a single C
#  source file and a man page. A partial alternative to shstat is GNU find
#  via its printf argument.
