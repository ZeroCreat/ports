# Description: A set of utilities to test how similar two files are.
#  similarity-utils is a set of two programs to give a quantitative measure
#  of how similar two files are, on a scale 0 to 1. similarity_by_diff
#  measures the number of difference lines reported by diff(1), while
#  similarity_by_zlib tries compressing the two files, both separately and
#  together, and comparing the results.
