# Description: A relay for bidirectional data transfer.
#  Socat is a relay for bidirectional data transfer between two independent
#  data channels. Each of these data channels may be a file, pipe, device
#  (terminal or modem, etc.), socket (Unix, IP4, IP6 - raw, UDP, TCP),
#  SSL, a client for SOCKS4, or proxy CONNECT. It supports broadcasts
#  and multicasts, abstract Unix sockets, Linux tun/tap, GNU readline,
#  and PTYs. It provides forking, logging, and dumping and different modes
#  for interprocess communication. Many options are available for tuning
#  socat and its channels. Socat can be used, for example, as a TCP relay
#  (one-shot or daemon), as a daemon-based socksifier, as a shell interface
#  to Unix sockets, as an IP6 relay, or for redirecting TCP-oriented programs
#  to a serial line.

# Depends on: libc6, libreadline5, libssl0.9.8, libwrap0
