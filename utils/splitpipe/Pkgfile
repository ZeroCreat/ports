# Description: A tool to distribute piped data over several volumes, like DVDs or CDs.
#  Splitpipe accepts the streamed output of a program such as tar on
#  standard input and distributes it over multiple output volumes. These
#  volumes contain labels that guarantee integrity, verify that the entire
#  volume is read, and that they are read in the proper order. Combined
#  with the built-in ring buffer, this allows for the high speed backup of
#  full filesystems to DVD or CD.
