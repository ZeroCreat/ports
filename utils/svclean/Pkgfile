# Description: Utilities for enhancing svscan and supervise
# With these tools, you get clean shutdown (i.e., services are guaranteed
# to be stopped before their loggers, so no logs are lost) and supervised
# logging of svscan's and supervise's output (so if the last-resort logger
# is killed, it can be restarted). svclean-conf is a configuration package
# for svclean. These features are practically necessary for running svscan
# as process 1, but are useful even when svscan does not run as process
# 1. Ideally, equivalent features would be included in a future version
# of daemontools, and this package would become obsolete.
