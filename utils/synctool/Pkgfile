# Description: A cluster administration tool.
# synctool is a cluster administration tool that keeps configuration
# files synchronized across all nodes in a cluster. Nodes may be part of
# a logical group or class, in which case they need a particular subset
# of configuration files. synctool can restart daemons when needed, if
# their relevant configuration files have been changed. synctool can also
# be used to do patch management or other system administrative tasks.
