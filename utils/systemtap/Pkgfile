# Description: SystemTap provides free software (GPL) infrastructure to simplify
# the gathering of information about the running Linux system. This assists
# diagnosis of a performance or functional problem. SystemTap eliminates the
# need for the developer to go through the tedious and disruptive instrument,
# recompile, install, and reboot sequence that may be otherwise required to
# collect data.
# SystemTap provides a simple command line interface and scripting language
# for writing instrumentation for a live running kernel. We are publishing
# samples, as well as enlarging the internal tapset script library to aid
# reuse and abstraction. We also plan to support probing userspace applications.
# We are investigating interfacing Systemtap with similar tools such as Frysk,
# Oprofile and LTT.
# Current project members include Red Hat, IBM, Intel, and Hitachi.
