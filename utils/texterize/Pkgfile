# Description: Text and metadata extraction tool
# Extraction tool which can be used to quickly get the text content of a file.
#  It currently supports file formats like PDF, Excel, Powerpoint, Word, RTF,
#  WordPerfect, MP3, Ogg, and all OpenDocument file formats. The output of
#  texterize is either text or XML. It is also designed to work with Unicode
#  input and output, and the default output character set is UTF-8. Texterize
#  also has a recursive mode so that whole directories (or whole filesystems)
#  can be converted to text. This recursion also works through archive files
#  and compressed files like zip, tar, and gz files.
