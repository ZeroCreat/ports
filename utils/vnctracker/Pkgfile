# Description: A tracker of dynamic IP addresses for HTTP VNC connections.
#  VNCTracker keeps a list of hosts on various Internet accounts. Rather
#  than email or phone each user whenever you need a current IP address
#  for connecting with VNC, you visit the Web page generated by VNCTracker
#  that shows the updated IP address for that host. It will then build .vnc
#  files to easily start VNC sessions served via HTTP.
#  .
