# Description: A program for building complex pipelines.
#  xtee (cross-tee/expanded tee) is a program for building complex
#  pipelines. It resembles the tee command, except that instead of copying
#  stdin to stdout, it copies an input file to stdout and stdin to an
#  output file. You can use xtee for building things like a bidirectional
#  HTTP filter (using netcat and sed).
