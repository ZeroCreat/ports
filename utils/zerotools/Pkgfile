# Description: Tools to aid compression of virtual machine disks with Linux virtual machines.
#  Zerotools are a set of tools to aid keeping virtual disks clean by
#  filling binary zero to those regions which are no longer in "use". This
#  is done on-the-fly or manually, depending on which tool suits the needs
#  best. The tools do not compete with other programs that rewrite removed
#  files in order to make their restoration close to impossible. Zerotools
#  are mostly useful for people who compress or archive virtual machines
#  constantly. The tools are run inside the virtualized Linux system and
#  are distribution-agnostic.
