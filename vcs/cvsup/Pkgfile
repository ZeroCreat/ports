# Description: CVS-Aware Network File Distribution System
#  CVSup is a software package for transferring and updating collections
#  of files across a network. It consists of a server called cvsupd and a
#  client called cvsup. CVSup is faster (often by an order of magnitude)
#  and more flexible than traditional network packages such as rdist and
#  sup. In addition, CVSup has special knowledge of RCS files (as used by
#  CVS). Software projects using CVSup to distribute their CVS repositories
#  include FreeBSD, KDE, and (shortly) Postgres.
