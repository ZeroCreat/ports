# Description: David's advanced revision control system.
# Darcs is an advanced revision control system. It has two particularly
# distinctive features which differ from other revision control systems:
# each copy of the source is a fully functional branch, and underlying it
# is a consistent and powerful theory of patches. In spite of its power,
# darcs is simple to use, in part because of the symmetry that is restored
# by making each copy of the repository a branch.
