# Description: Scripts to manage a series of patches by keeping track of the changes.
# Quilt is a set of scripts to manage a series of patches by keeping track
# of the changes each patch makes. Patches can be applied, un-applied,
# refreshed, etc. The key philosophical concept is that your primary output
# is patches, not amp;quot;.camp;quot; files or amp;quot;.hamp;quot;
# files, so patches are the first-class object here. It was originally
# based on Andrew Morton's patch scripts published on the Linux kernel
# mailing list a while ago, but has been heavily modified since then.
