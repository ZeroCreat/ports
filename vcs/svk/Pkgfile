# Description: A decentralized version control system based on Subversion.
#  svk is a distributed version control system designed from the ground
#  up to integrate cleanly with Subversion, the emerging standard in
#  enterprise version control. With SVK, advanced branching and merging
#  and even offline commits are easy.
