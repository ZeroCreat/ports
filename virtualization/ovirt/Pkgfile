# Description: An embeddable hypervisor and virtual machine management suite.
#  oVirt is a small host image that provides libvirt service and hosts
#  virtual machines (oVirt Node) and a Web-based virtual machine management
#  console (oVirt Server Suite). It is built using existing open source
#  components (libvirt, kvm, collectd, Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, and
#  freeIPA). Presently, the oVirt Server Suite only manages the oVirt Node,
#  but the goal is to be able to manage other node types and hypervisors
#  in the future.
