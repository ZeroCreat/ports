# Description: A C++ library for using FastCGI.
#  fastcgi++ is a C++ library for developing Web applications in C++
#  with the FastCGI protocol. This library does not support the old CGI
#  protocol. It effectively manages simultaneous requests without the need
#  for multiple threads. Session data is organized into meaningful data types
#  as opposed to a series of text strings. Internationalization and Unicode
#  support is another priority. The library is templated to allow internal
#  wide character use, while converting down to UTF-8 upon transmission to
#  the client.
