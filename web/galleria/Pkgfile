# Description: A fantastic javascript image gallery written in jQuery
#  Galleria is a javascript image gallery written in jQuery. It loads
#  the images one by one from an unordered list and displays thumbnails
#  when each image is loaded. It will create thumbnails for you if you
#  choose so, scaled or unscaled, centered and cropped inside a fixed
#  thumbnail box defined by CSS. The core of Galleria lies in it's smart
#  preloading behaviour, snappiness and the fresh absence of obtrusive
#  design elements. Use it as a foundation for your custom styled
#  image gallery. Visit the Galleria home page for more info and demos:
