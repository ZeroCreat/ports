# Description: An (X)HTML preprocessor.
#  HSC (HTML Sucks Completely) is a developer tool for HTML projects. It
#  is mainly intended for creating and maintaining larger Web sites, with
#  a focus on compact and standards-conforming code. Its source texts are
#  HTML files that use an extended syntax allowing for macros, conditionals,
#  variables, expressions, etc. These sources are transformed into static
#  (X)HTML pages. HSC checks the result for many common errors such as
#  missing end tags and nesting mistakes, both in the markup and, to a
#  limited extent, in CSS. As a commandline tool, it can be used together
#  with "make", and a dependency generator is included. The macro library
#  features things like navigation menus, LaTeX-style sections, footnotes and
#  bibliographies, semiautomatic table-based layout, and database/scripting
#  interfaces.
