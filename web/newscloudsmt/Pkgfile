# Description: A platform to run a topic-based social news Web site.
#  The Social Media Toolkit (SMT), is a platform designed to help
#  organizations run community-driven, topic-based, and geo-centric
#  news Web sites, similar to NewsCloud.com, albeit simpler and more
#  streamlined. Essentially, you can quickly set up and publish one or
#  more topic-specific news sites with great social media features such
#  as registration, voting, comments, newswires, posting, and resource
#  links. Stories are initially seeded from NewsCloud's topic clouds. It's
#  easy to create new topic clouds if you want to.
