# Description: A small and fast window manager for X11.
#  sWM (the Small Window Manager) provides a very fast user interface and
#  features that are not found in other small-footprint window managers. It
#  was written for small computers with very little memory and small screen
#  sizes, is GNOME compliant, and supports pixmap based themes.
