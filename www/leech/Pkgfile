# Description: Recursive download automation tool
#  Leech was developed to relieve one from having to go through sites,
#  constantly clicking "Save As...", "OK", etc. Instead, feed Leech a
#  URL and tell it which filetypes to download, and it will crawl through
#  any page that meets Leech's restrictions and dowload any file of the
#  specified type.
