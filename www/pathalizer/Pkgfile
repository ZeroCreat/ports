# Description: A tool for visualizing the paths users take when browsing a Web site.
#  Pathalizer is a tool for visualizing the paths most users take when
#  browsing a Web site. This information can be used to decide how to
#  improve the navigation of the site, and for determining which parts are
#  most worth improving and keeping up to date. It generates a directed,
#  weighed graph from an Apache log, but could easily be modified to analyze
#  any list of events.
