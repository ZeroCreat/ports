# Description: A Web development engine.
#  site-C-ing is a Web development engine that uses C++ as a development
#  language. The source code for the Web is a mixture of HTML (or whatever
#  is the target content-type) and embedded C++. The engine preprocesses
#  files, compiles them using the C++ compiler and serves to the user using
#  .so shared objects. Each "component" can be considered a C++ class with
#  the logical consequence of being able to derive one from another, etc.
