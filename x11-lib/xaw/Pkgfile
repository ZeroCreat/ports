# Description: X11 Athena Widget library
#  libXaw7 provides the second version of Xaw, the Athena Widgets tookit,
#  which is largely used by legacy X applications.  This version is the
#  most common version, as version 6 is considered deprecated, and version
#  8, which adds Xprint support, is unsupported and not widely used.
#  In general, use of a more modern toolkit such as GTK+ is recommended.
