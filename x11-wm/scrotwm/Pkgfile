# Description: A small dynamic tiling window manager for X11.
#  scrotwm is a minimalistic window manager that tries to stay out of the way
#  so that valuable screen real estate can be used for much more important
#  stuff. It has sane defaults and does not require one to learn a language
#  to do any configuration. It was written by hackers for hackers and it
#  strives to be small, compact and fast.
