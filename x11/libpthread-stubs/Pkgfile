# Description: pthread stubs not provided by native libc
#  This library provides weak aliases for pthread functions not provided
#  in libc or otherwise available by default. Libraries like libxcb rely
#  on pthread stubs to use pthreads optionally, becoming thread-safe
#  when linked to libpthread, while avoiding any performance hit when
#  running single-threaded. libpthread-stubs supports this behavior even
#  on platforms which do not supply all the necessary pthread stubs. On
#  platforms which already supply all the necessary pthread stubs, this
#  package has no content.
