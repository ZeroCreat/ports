# Description: 3D scenegraph binary files
#  A portable, high level graphics toolkit for the development of high
#  performance graphics applications such as flight simulators, games,
#  virtual reality or scientific visualization. Providing an object
#  orientated framework on top of OpenGL, it frees the developer from
#  implementing and optimizing low level graphics calls, and provide many
#  additional utilities for rapid development of graphics applications.
