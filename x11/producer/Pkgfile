# Description: Open Producer
#  Open Producer (or simply Producer) is a cross-platform C++/OpenGL library
#  that is focused on Camera control. Producer's Camera provides projection
#  9, field of view, viewpoint control, and frame control. Further, Producer
#  can be used in a multi-tasking environment to allow multiple Camera's
#  to run in parallel supporting hardware configurations with multiple
#  display subsystems. Threading, Camera synchronization and frame rate
#  control are simplified in the Producer programming interface.
