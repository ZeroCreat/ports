# Description: X C Binding - protocol descriptions
#  xcb-proto contains descriptions of the X Window System core protocol and
#  selected extensions in an XML-based data format. The X C Binding (XCB)
#  library uses these descriptions to generate much of its code. You only need
#  this package if you want to compile XCB or otherwise make use of these
#  protocol descriptions.
#  .
#  The XCB library provides an interface to the X Window System protocol,
#  designed to replace the Xlib interface.  XCB provides several advantages over
#  Xlib:
#  .
#   * Size: small library and lower memory footprint
#   * Latency hiding: batch several requests and wait for the replies later
#   * Direct protocol access: one-to-one mapping between interface and protocol
#   * Thread support: access XCB from multiple threads, with no explicit locking
#   * Easy creation of new extensions: automatically generates interface from
#     machine-parsable protocol descriptions
