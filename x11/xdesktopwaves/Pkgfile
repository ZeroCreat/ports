# Description: A simulation of water waves on the X11 desktop.
#  xdesktopwaves is a cellular automata which sets the background of an
#  X11 desktop as if it were under water. Window and mouse movements cause
#  ripples on the desktop like ships on the sea. You can also simulate rain
#  or a storm stirring up the water.
