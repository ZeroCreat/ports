# Description: Software to allow persistent, remote, graphical applications.
#  X Persistent Remote Applications (xpra) is "screen for X". It lets you
#  run applications remotely (like ordinary X or VNC), but unlike ordinary
#  X, these applications are "persistent" if you lose your connection,
#  or even if you want to switch to another computer. Also unlike VNC,
#  they are ordinary applications on your desktop managed by your window
#  manager, not trapped in a box.
