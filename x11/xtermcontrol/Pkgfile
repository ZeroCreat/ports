# Description: A tool for dynamically changing the properties of a running XFree86 xterm.
# xtermcontrol enables dynamic control of XFree86 xterm properties. It
# makes it easy to change colors, titles, fonts, and the geometry of
# a running xterm, as well as to report the current settings of the
# properties. Window manipulations such as (de)iconify, raise and lower,
# maximize and restore, and reset are also supported. It also lets advanced
# users issue any xterm control sequence.
