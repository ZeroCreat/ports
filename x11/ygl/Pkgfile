# Description: Ygl is an X11 library that emulates the 2D routines of SGI's GL (sometimes called IRIS GL)
# Please note that GL is different from OpenGL. Ygl is very simple to use,
# and very fast. The 2D routines are built around the standard X11 libraries
# and reported to be faster than GL itself. SGI's GL has 3D routines as
# well and Ygl tries to emulate these using OpenGL. However this does'nt
# work yet with Mesa and hence there is no 3D support in this release. This
# release will also work with FORTRAN code. This package comes with a useful
# set of examples. There is also a contributed widget (glwidget.h) included
# with Ygl and this library too is included along with its examples.

# Maintainer: Roman Senn <rs@adfinis.com>
# Depends on: libc6
